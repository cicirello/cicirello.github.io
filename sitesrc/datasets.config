<h2>Datasets</h2>
<p>This page contains datasets from my research, which spans a variety of applications of artificial intelligence, 
machine learning, evolutionary computation, and swarm intelligence.  You can also explore my datasets archived 
in the Harvard Dataverse: <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/vacicirello">Vincent A. Cicirello Dataverse</a>.  
I will be adding more datasets here in the near future:</p>
<ul itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ItemList">
<li itemprop="itemListElement" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ListItem"><meta itemprop="position" content="1">A Benchmark Set of Instances for <a itemprop="url mainEntityOfPage" href="/datasets/wtsds/">Weighted Tardiness Scheduling with Sequence-Dependent Setups</a>. 
Weighted Tardiness Scheduling with Sequence-Dependent Setups is an NP-Hard single machine scheduling problem.  The problem instances in this benchmark set have varying levels of duedate tightness, duedate range, and setup time severity.</li>
