What you need: Eight (8) raspberry pis in standard raspberry pi cases, along with any relevant cables for power and networking. Two (2) napkin holders of the type where napkins are stacked. Must have openings in sides, such as the steel lattice design that I used here. A bag of cable/zip ties (I used 16 total). Step 1: Zip up the napkin weight Use cable/zip ties to hold up the napkin weight on one of the napkin holders so that it is approximately level with the sides of the napkin holder. Step 2: Attach the second napkin holder The napkin holders that I used have feet that prevent aligning directly atop each other. Rotate the second napkin holder 45 degrees relative to the first. Use cable ties to attach. Make sure you use enough cable ties sufficiently tightened to ensure that the top napkin holder won't move. Specifically, use two cable ties on each of the three corners that come into contact with the bottom napkin holder. Additionally, use one cable tie to attach the napkin weight of the bottom holder to the bottom of the top holder. Step 3: Trim the cable ties Well, do what the heading of this step says. Step 4: Zip the napkin weight to create a shelf Use cable ties to prop up the napkin weight of the top napkin holder. I connected three cable ties in sequence to span the width of the napkin holder both below and above the napkin weight. I repeated this a couple inches away creating a shelf, which I'm using to hold a network switch. Step 5: Arrange your Raspberry Pis and Route Cables Each napkin holder is large enough for four raspberry pis in standard cases, each rotated such that ports are accessible via two sides at the corners. If you're using wired networking, you can sit a switch on top of the shelf you created in step 4. I'm using a couple phone chargers as a power source. I currently have them simply sitting next to the rack. Route your power and network cables through the lattice sides of the napkin holders. I used 3 foot long cables, which is partially to blame for the messy wiring in the photo. One foot length cables would be better (and neater). The cable routing will also turn out better if you are more patient than I am.", "url": "http://www.cicirello.org/howto/pirack/"},

Prior to joining the Stockton University faculty, Dr. Cicirello worked as a Research Scientist for Drexel University (2003-2005) at Drexel's Applied Communications and Information Networking (ACIN) Center in Camden, NJ as part of an interdisciplinary team from Drexel's Computer Science Department and Electrical Engineering Department developing the Secure Wireless Agent Testbed. During a 2012 sabbatical from Stockton University, Dr. Cicirello collaborated with Drexel's Geometric and Intelligent Computing Laboratory (GICL), as a Visiting Associate Professor, on research related to digital engineering data management. He earned a Ph.D. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University in 2003. While a Ph.D. student in CMU's Robotics Institute from 1999 to 2003, Vince's research included applications of swarm intelligence, research in applying machine learning to the control of metaheuristics, as well as multi-agent/multi-robot coordination. Vince's dissertation research was applied to industrial scheduling problems as well as robotic space exploration. One outcome of his dissertation research is a paper published and presented at the 2005 National Conference on Artificial Intelligence for which Vincent Cicirello, and his co-author and dissertation adviser Steve Smith, were awarded the 2005 AAAI Outstanding Paper Award. As part of a dual M.S./B.S. program, he earned a M.S. in Computer Science, a B.S. in Computer Science, and a B.S. in Mathematics from Drexel University in 1999.

Cicirello Technical Report, Geometric and Intelligent Computing Laboratory, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, March 1999.

A graph matching problem is a problem involving some form of comparison between graphs. Some of the many application areas of such problems include information retrieval, sub-circuit identification, chemical structure classification, and networks. Problems of efficient graph matching arise in any field that may be modeled with graphs. For example, any problem that can be modeled with binary relations between entities in the domain is such a problem. The individual entities in the problem domain become nodes in the graph. And each binary relation becomes an edge between the appropriate nodes. Although it is possible to formulate such a large array of problems as graph matching problems, it is not necessarily a good idea to do so. Graph matching is a very difficult problem. The graph isomorphism problem is to determine if there exists a one-to-one mapping from the nodes of one graph to the nodes of a second graph that preserves adjacency. Similarly, the subgraph isomorphism problem is to determine if there exists a one-to-one mapping from the nodes of a given graph to the nodes of a subgraph of a second graph that preserves adjacency. The largest common subgraph problem is to find the largest subgraphs of two given graphs such that the subgraphs are isomorphic. The digraph D-morphism problem is to determine if there exists a one-to-one mapping from the nodes of one directed graph to the nodes of a second directed graph that preserves adjacency if you disregard the directions of the arcs. The closely related problems of subgraph isomorphism, largest common subgraph, and digraph D-morphism are known to be NP-complete. Whether or not the graph isomorphism problem is in the class of NP-complete problems is an open question.

[BIB] Abstract Nearly all major commercial computer-aided design systems have adopted a feature-based design approach to solid modeling. Models are created via a sequence of operations which apply design features to incremental versions of a design model. Even surfacing, free-form surface shaping, and deformation operations are internally represented in modeling systems as features in a \"history tree\" that generates the final design. Much in the same manner that Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) trees for an individual model can be non-unique, these design feature histories for solid models might be ordered in a number of ways and still result in the same final geometry and topology. We formulate this problem symbolically and present geometric reasoning techniques to generate a canonical form for certain classes of design feature histories. We define this representation as a Model Dependency Graph (MDG) and show how it can be used as a basis for developing techniques for managing databases of solid models. Using the MDG, we introduce algorithms that can assess the similarity of solid models based on design features. One of these algorithms computes an approximation to the subgraph isomorphism and graph isomorphism problems using a random restart gradient descent approach. Another of these algorithms uses the search method known as A* to detect subgraph isomorphism.

We consider the problem of weighted tardiness scheduling with sequence-dependent setups with unknown arrival times in a dynamic environment, and show that randomization of state-of-the-art dispatch heuristics for this problem in this manner can improve performance. Furthermore, we find that the \"easier\" the problem, the less benefit there is from randomization; the \"harder\" the problem, the more benefit.

In optimization contexts, it can provide a means for overcoming the deficiencies of available search heuristics and broadening search in productive directions.

In contrast to previous approaches, which have used rank-ordering as a basis for randomization, our approach instead relies on assigned heuristic value. Use of heuristic value is important because it makes it possible to vary the level of stochasticity in relation to the discriminatory power of the heuristic in different decision contexts, and hence concentrate search around those decisions where the heuristic is least informative. To evaluate the efficacy of the approach, we apply it to a complex, weighted-tardiness scheduling problem. Taking a state-of-the-art heuristic for this scheduling problem as a starting point, we demonstrate an ability to consistently and significantly improve on the deterministic heuristic solution across a broad range of problem instances.

In particular, we are developing an extension to the traditional three-layered robot architecture that enables robots to interact directly at each layer: at the behavioral level, the robots create distributed control loops; at the executive level, they synchronize task execution; at the planning level, they use market-based techniques to assign tasks, form teams, and allocate resources. We illustrate these ideas in the context of a Mars exploration scenario.", "url": "http://www.cicirello.org/publications/nasa-pss02-final.pdf"},

This is certainly the case with stochastic sampling algorithms such as heuristic-biased stochastic sampling (HBSS) and value-biased stochastic sampling (VBSS), wherein a heuristic is used to bias a stochastic policy for choosing among alternative branches in the search tree. One complication in getting the most out of algorithms like HBSS and VBSS in a given problem domain is the need to identify the most effective search heuristic. In many domains, the relative performance of various heuristics tends to vary across different problem instances and no single heuristic dominates. In such cases, the choice of any given heuristic will be limiting and it would be advantageous to gain the collective power of several heuristics. Toward this goal, this paper describes a framework for integrating multiple heuristics within a stochastic sampling search algorithm. In its essence, the framework uses online-generated statistical models of the search performance of different base heuristics to select which to employ on each subsequent iteration of the search. To estimate the solution quality distribution resulting from repeated application of a strong heuristic within a stochastic search, we propose the use of models from extreme value theory (EVT). Our EVT-motivated approach is validated on the NP-Hard problem of resource-constrained project scheduling with time windows (RCPSP/max). Using VBSS as a base stochastic sampling algorithm, the integrated use of a set of project scheduling heuristics is shown to be competitive with the current best known heuristic algorithm for RCPSP/max and in some cases even improves upon best known solutions to difficult benchmark instances.", "url": "http://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2004cp.html"},

February 2004. Invited Presentation. [BIB] Abstract The Secure Wireless Agent Testbed (SWAT) is a unique facility developed at Drexel University in collaboration with Sarnoff Corporation to study integration, networking and information assurance for next-generation wireless mobile agent systems. It is the only known implemented system fully integrating: mobile agents, MANETs, and security. The authors believe that SWAT is the largest known multi-agent system living on a MANET (802.11b wireless network with ad hoc routing), consisting of dozens of mobile hosts (PDAs, laptops) and thousands of static and mobile software agents. Novel mechanisms have been developed for SWAT integrating autonomous agent technologies with public-key and symmetric key encryption to support secure communication, at multiple OSI layers, among groups of hosts and agents. SWAT Security is monitored by agents that manage keys, assess network traffic patterns and analyze host behaviors. Agents can use machine learning to develop profiles for nominal agent, hardware platform and network states. Given learned profiles, detection agents identify specific problems in SWAT, including over-runs/capture, and malicious insiders. Other agents monitor the health of the network and the devices in the network, looking for network attacks and security breaches. Using this framework, agents can revoke access rights for suspicious hosts or agents and adaptively re-route traffic at the network layer to improve the information integrity of the overall system. Agents also provide the implementation framework for decentralized user applications, including those for authentication, collaboration, messaging, and remote sensor monitoring.", "url": "http://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2004darpa.html"},

[PDF] [BIB] [DOI] Abstract Designing decentralized software applications for a wireless network environment offers harsh challenges to the software engineer. All of the usual difficulties associated with a distributed system are present, but are amplified by the inherent dynamics and uncertainty of the wireless network. This paper takes an agent-oriented software engineering perspective in considering how to design decentralized software systems for a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) of resource-constrained devices. Specifically, the authors codify within the context of a software design pattern the concept of an agent swarm. Swarms of mobile agents have been used in the development of applications to support coordination and collaboration in a live MANET test bed. Work is underway to transition some of this technology into use by public protectors as part of the Philadelphia area urban wireless network testbed. The objectives of this paper include motivating the need for a swarm-based approach to distributed software for wireless environments and discussing the critical issues involved with mobile agents swarming on a MANET.

Cicirello, Andrew Mroczkowski, and William Regli In Proceedings of the 2005 IEEE Second Symposium on Multi-Agent Security and Survivability, pages 49-57. August 2005. [PDF] [BIB] [DOI] Abstract Designing decentralized software applications for a wireless network environment offers harsh challenges to the software engineer. All of the usual difficulties associated with a distributed system are present, but are amplified by the inherent dynamics and uncertainty of the wireless network. This paper takes an agent-oriented software engineering perspective in considering how to design decentralized software systems for a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) of resource-constrained devices. Specifically, the authors codify within the context of a software design pattern the concept of an agent swarm. Swarms of mobile agents have been used in the development of applications to support coordination and collaboration in a live MANET test bed. Work is underway to transition some of this technology into use by public protectors as part of the Philadelphia area urban wireless network testbed. The objectives of this paper include motivating the need for a swarm-based approach to distributed software for wireless environments and discussing the critical issues involved with mobile agents swarming on a MANET. For example, one such design issue is the selection of migration patterns for use by the swarming agents. Several different types of itinerary patterns are evaluated within the context of a mobile agent swarm.", "url": "http://www.cicirello.org/publications/MASS2005-pattern.pdf"},

Full paper here as Technical Report. [PDF] [BIB] Abstract The complexity of many combinatorial optimization problems often preclude the application of exact problem solving techniques as the problem is scaled to real-world size. For example, for a problem that is NP-Hard in the strong sense, any algorithm that guarantees that its solutions are optimal is going to be limited in the size of the instance that it can solve given computational limitations. Rather than requiring \"optimal\" solutions, an alternative is to favor sufficiently good solutions that can be found efficiently. One approach to this uses a randomized heuristic algorithm. This paper specifically considers an algorithm known as Value Biased Stochastic Sampling (VBSS). VBSS uses a heuristic function to bias the random generation of a proposed solution to the problem. This process is repeated some number of times and retains only the best solution found over several trials. The key to the effectiveness of VBSS is the choice of the heuristic function. The job of the heuristic function is to provide problem dependent evaluation of the choices that can be made. This evaluation is used to bias the random decisions during the problem solving process. At the time of the design of such an algorithm, it may not be obvious which of several heuristics are best. During the past few years, we have been developing techniques for allowing VBSS to self-select which heuristic to use. Our approach relies on modeling the distribution of the quality of solutions obtained by VBSS over its allocated set of restarts. This paper presents some of our analysis of potential models, including goodness of fit tests for several possible assumptions we can make about the distribution of the quality of solutions.

Cicirello In Proceedings of the Tenth International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS 2017), pages 2-10. AAAI Press, June 2017. [PDF] [BIB] [PUB] [arXiv] Abstract In this paper, we propose: (a) a restart schedule for an adaptive simulated annealer, and (b) parallel simulated annealing, with an adaptive and parameter-free annealing schedule. The foundation of our approach is the Modified Lam annealing schedule, which adaptively controls the temperature parameter to track a theoretically ideal rate of acceptance of neighboring states. A sequential implementation of Modified Lam simulated annealing is almost parameter-free. However, it requires prior knowledge of the annealing length. We eliminate this parameter using restarts, with an exponentially increasing schedule of annealing lengths. We then extend this restart schedule to parallel implementation, executing several Modified Lam simulated annealers in parallel, with varying initial annealing lengths, and our proposed parallel annealing length schedule. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on an NP-Hard scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup constraints. We compare our approach to fixed length restarts, both sequentially and in parallel. Our results show that our approach can achieve substantial performance gains, throughout the course of the run, demonstrating our approach to be an effective anytime algorithm.

Getting these control parameters \"right\" is often critical to search performance. My research in this area includes both automated parameter tuning, as well as self-adaptive metahueristics or automated parameter control. My research in this area also includes multi-heuristic search. Some forms of search require the guidance of a heuristic, and the \"best\" heuristic for a problem may vary widely from that of another problem, or may even vary across instances of a problem. Some of my research has applied machine learning to enabling metaheuristics to adapt their choice of heuristic. Selected Publications Variable Annealing Length and Parallelism in Simulated Annealing.

	{"title": "Research - Vincent Cicirello - Professor of Computer Science", "tags": "", "type": "html", "text": "Research My research interests are primarily within evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence, biologically-inspired multiagent systems, and applied artificial intelligence. I explore both theoretical and applied topics in these areas, with a particular interest in how theory impacts practice. Current and past application domains for my research include scheduling and planning, coordination and logistics, computer-aided engineering, and manufacturing. I also, on occasion, conduct research on computer science education topics. Search Landscape Analysis Recently, I have been exploring the fitness landscapes of permutation optimization problems, problems where one must find an optimal ordering of some discrete set (e.g., scheduling problems). Such permutation problems fall into one of three broad categories, depending upon the structural characteristics of greatest influence on solution fitness (absolute positioning of elements, relative positioning of elements, or element precedences), although some problems may span more than one of these categories. Among other things, my research on permutation fitness landscapes has introduced a theoretical framework enabling exploring the effects of these structural properties on search performance. This includes the \"Permutation in a Haystack\" problem which enables specifying permutation fitness landscapes; as well as the \"Calculus of Search Landscapes\", a new tool for search landscape analysis that focuses on rates of change of fitness landscape topology, complementing other search landscape analysis tools such as fitness-distance correlation. More info, including selected relevant publications.... Self-Adaptive / Self-Tuning Metaheuristics Genetic algorithms, and more generally, evolutionary computation, along with other metaheuristics such as simulated annealing, ant colony optimization, etc, often involve a large number of so-called control parameters (e.g., mutation and crossover rates in genetic algorithms, parameters to control the cooling schedule in simulated annealing, and so forth). Getting these control parameters \"right\" is often critical to search performance. My research in this area includes both automated parameter tuning, as well as self-adaptive metahueristics or automated parameter control. My research in this area also includes multi-heuristic search. Some forms of search require the guidance of a heuristic, and the \"best\" heuristic for a problem may vary widely from that of another problem, or may even vary across instances of a problem. Some of my research has applied machine learning to enabling metaheuristics to adapt their choice of heuristic. More info, including selected relevant publications....

Swarm Intelligence Swarm intelligence refers to multiagent systems whose behavior is motivated by models of naturally occurring swarming systems, such as social insect swarms (e.g., ants, wasps, etc). My past research in this area includes applications of models of wasp task allocation and wasp social hierarchy formation to industrial scheduling and coordination problems, as well as multirobot coordination in space exploration. I have also explored applications of swarming agents to data management and network monitoring on mobile ad hoc networks. More info, including selected relevant publications.... Multi-Agent Systems / Multi-Robot Systems Although much of my research on multiagent / multirobot systems is specifically related to swarm intelligence, I have additionally conducted research related to other aspects of these systems, including market-based coordination, security engineering of multiagent systems, issues related to mobile agents on ad hoc wireless networks, power aware agents, and multiagent collaboration tools. More info, including selected relevant publications.... Applications of AI to Computer-Aided Engineering My research also includes applications of artificial intelligence to problems within the broad domain of Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE). These problems are mostly related to data management in large engineering digital libraries, such as automated engineering format classification, and search and retrieval of engineering artifacts, such as Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models based upon structural similarity.

	{"title": "Teaching - Vincent Cicirello - Professor of Computer Science", "tags": "", "type": "html", "text": "Teaching Teaching Schedule My teaching schedule at Stockton University for the next couple semesters includes: Fall 2017: CSIS 4485: Software and Security Engineering CSIS 4104: Data Structures and Algorithms II Spring 2018: CSIS 4463: Artificial Intelligence CSIS 4104: Data Structures and Algorithms II GNM 2248: Artificial Intelligence in Society Courses Recently Taught CSIS 4485: Software and Security Engineering (Last taught: Fall 2017, Syllabus): An introduction to software engineering and security engineering in software systems. The course addresses universal software engineering techniques as well as techniques for development of critical software systems where the cost of system failure is potentially high. Software engineering topics covered will include software process models, agile software development methods, requirements engineering, system modeling, architectural design, implementation, software testing, and evolution. Topics related to software dependability and security engineering are also covered. CSIS 4481: Cryptography and Data Security (Last taught: Fall 2016, Syllabus): Cryptography has become an essential tool for data security. It is used to provide data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It supports the authentication of data and protection of privacy. However, cryptography is only one component of a security system. There are hardware, software engineering, social and political issues that also must be considered. This course provides a broad view of security with practical applications of cryptography to data security. Specific topics include classical and modern encryption techniques, steganography, and human factors. CSIS 4466: Computer Graphics (Last taught: Fall 2015, Syllabus): This course provides an introduction to 2D and 3D computer graphics including the study of hardware, software, algorithms, modeling, rendering, and applications. Topics will be introduced using the Java 2D and 3D APIs. CSIS 4463: Artificial Intelligence (Last taught: Spring 2017, Syllabus): A study of tools, techniques, and applications associated with intelligent computer systems. The course will include topics from classical symbolic AI as well as topics from computational intelligence. Topics will include intelligent problem-solving methods, knowledge representation, heuristics, genetic algorithms, and selected topics from machine learning. Counts as an elective for the Minor in Behavioral Neuroscience. CSIS 4104: Data Structures and Algorithms II (Last taught: Fall 2017, Syllabus): In this course, students deepen their knowledge of the design and analysis of computer algorithms. Advanced topics in algorithms and algorithm analysis covered in the course include graphs and graph algorithms, string matching, multi-threaded algorithms, and NP-completeness. Taught using Python. CSIS 3103: Data Structures and Algorithms I (Last taught: Spring 2017, Syllabus): Advanced topics in the specification, implementation, and use of important data structures and associated algorithms. Data structures to be studied include stacks, queues, lists, trees, heaps, priority queues, sets/maps, and hash tables. Algorithm analysis is also studied, with emphasis on searching and sorting. Programming projects provide experience using the concepts covered in the course. Taught using Java. GNM 2248: Artificial Intelligence in Society (Last taught: Spring 2017, Syllabus): This course will provide a broad overview and introduction to the field of artificial intelligence (AI) focusing on the impacts it has made on society during the past 50 years. The intended audience for this course is that of the general student. No mathematical background is required. The course will begin by providing a broad overview of what AI is, and what it is not, including a discussion of the notions of Strong and Weak AI. Strong AI hypothesizes that the human mind is nothing more than a computational device and thus that computers can in principle be programmed with the capability of thought (i.e., to truly reason and solve problems). Contrast this with Weak AI which does not focus on whether machines can be made to actually think, but rather whether machines can be made to act intelligently. We will read and discuss articles by the pioneering scientists and philosophers that explore these notions. Next, the course will focus on introducing the student to applications of AI that have been making their ways into our everyday lives. Attention will be placed on the ethical issues and the impacts AI technology will continue to make on society. The course will include a combination of lectures, class discussion of films (both fiction and non-fiction) and assigned readings (both non-fiction and fiction), as well as current day news articles. Counts as an elective for the Minor in Behavioral Neuroscience. Fulfills university's Historically Conscious (H) requirement, and offered as a Writing Across the Curriculum (W2) course. Other Courses Taught Courses in this section are those that I haven't taught for a while. CSIS 4510: Topics in Computer Science: Human Performance Modeling (Last taught: Spring 2010): In this course, students synthesize their computer science coursework experience to explore real world problems of interest to local governmental agencies and industry.

CS 485 / CS 680: Knowledge-Based Agents (Last taught: Winter 2005): This is an advanced level undergraduate course / graduate level course that introduces the basic concepts of agent-based computing and exposes students to a wide set of topics ranging from mathematical logic to game theory to emergent behavior to distributed systems. CS 680 is the graduate course number. CS 481: Advanced Artificial Intelligence (Last taught: Summer 2005): This course covers advanced topics in artificial intelligence. The course particularly empasizes representation, reasoning, and decision-making under uncertainty, dealing with large real-world data sets, learning, and solving problems with time-varying properties. You will learn how to represent and reason about decision-making under uncertainty with methods such as Bayesian Networks and Decision Networks; how to represent and solve problems with time-varying properties using methods such as Markov Decision Processes; how to learn representations of poorly understood problems with machine learning (ML) methods such as reinforcement learning, neural networks, and other ML methods as time permits. CS 380: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Last taught: Spring 2005): This course will provide a foundational introduction to topics in Artificial Intelligence, emphasizing search, knowledge representation, and planning.", "url": "http://www.cicirello.org/teaching/"}]};
