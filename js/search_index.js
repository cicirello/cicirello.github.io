What you need: Eight (8) raspberry pis in standard raspberry pi cases, along with any relevant cables for power and networking. Two (2) napkin holders of the type where napkins are stacked. Must have openings in sides, such as the steel lattice design that I used here. A bag of cable/zip ties (I used 16 total). Step 1: Zip up the napkin weight Use cable/zip ties to hold up the napkin weight on one of the napkin holders so that it is approximately level with the sides of the napkin holder. Step 2: Attach the second napkin holder The napkin holders that I used have feet that prevent aligning directly atop each other. Rotate the second napkin holder 45 degrees relative to the first. Use cable ties to attach. Make sure you use enough cable ties sufficiently tightened to ensure that the top napkin holder won't move. Specifically, use two cable ties on each of the three corners that come into contact with the bottom napkin holder. Additionally, use one cable tie to attach the napkin weight of the bottom holder to the bottom of the top holder. Step 3: Trim the cable ties Well, do what the heading of this step says. Step 4: Zip the napkin weight to create a shelf Use cable ties to prop up the napkin weight of the top napkin holder. I connected three cable ties in sequence to span the width of the napkin holder both below and above the napkin weight. I repeated this a couple inches away creating a shelf, which I'm using to hold a network switch. Step 5: Arrange your Raspberry Pis and Route Cables Each napkin holder is large enough for four raspberry pis in standard cases, each rotated such that ports are accessible via two sides at the corners. If you're using wired networking, you can sit a switch on top of the shelf you created in step 4. I'm using a couple phone chargers as a power source. I currently have them simply sitting next to the rack. Route your power and network cables through the lattice sides of the napkin holders. I used 3 foot long cables, which is partially to blame for the messy wiring in the photo. One foot length cables would be better (and neater). The cable routing will also turn out better if you are more patient than I am.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/howto/pirack/"},

Cicirello is a Professor of Computer Science and Information Systems at Stockton University, where he has been a faculty member since 2005. He is among the founding faculty of Stockton University's Behavioral Neuroscience program, an interdisciplinary undergraduate minor first offered in 2010; and he is also associated with Stockton University's Computational Science Masters program. His research interests include artificial intelligence, evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence, and computer science education. He was designated an ACM Senior Member in 2011, received the 2005 AAAI Outstanding Paper award, and was nominated for the 2006 GECCO Best Genetic Algorithm Track award. He received a U.S. Patent in 2010, and has published over 50 journal and conference publications. He is a member of AAAI (Life member), ACM (Senior Member), ACM SIGCSE, ACM SIGAI, ACM SIGEVO, CCSC, IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, IEEE Computational Intelligence Society, and SIAM. Prior to joining the Stockton University faculty, Dr. Cicirello worked as a Research Scientist for Drexel University (2003-2005) at Drexel's Applied Communications and Information Networking (ACIN) Center in Camden, NJ as part of an interdisciplinary team from Drexel's Computer Science Department and Electrical Engineering Department developing the Secure Wireless Agent Testbed. During a 2012 sabbatical from Stockton University, Dr. Cicirello collaborated with Drexel's Geometric and Intelligent Computing Laboratory (GICL), as a Visiting Associate Professor, on research related to digital engineering data management. He earned a Ph.D. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University in 2003. While a Ph.D. student in CMU's Robotics Institute from 1999 to 2003, Vince's research included applications of swarm intelligence, research in applying machine learning to the control of metaheuristics, as well as multi-agent/multi-robot coordination. Vince's dissertation research was applied to industrial scheduling problems as well as robotic space exploration. One outcome of his dissertation research is a paper published and presented at the 2005 National Conference on Artificial Intelligence for which Vincent Cicirello, and his co-author and dissertation adviser Steve Smith, were awarded the 2005 AAAI Outstanding Paper Award. As part of a dual M.S./B.S. program, he earned a M.S. in Computer Science, a B.S. in Computer Science, and a B.S. in Mathematics from Drexel University in 1999. From 1998 to 1999, Vincent worked as a Research Assistant in Drexel University's Department of Computer Science and Mathematics in the GICL, where he participated in research related to managing large digital libraries of engineering data, such as his 1999 Masters Thesis where he developed algorithms for retrieving CAD/CAM data based on the design similarity of solid models. This research was later refined as well as expanded to retrieval based on manufacturing similarity, ultimately leading to a 2003 patent application, with U.S. patent granted in 2010.

Cicirello Technical Report, Geometric and Intelligent Computing Laboratory, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA, March 1999. Abstract Graph matching problems of varying types are important in a wide array of application areas. A graph matching problem is a problem involving some form of comparison between graphs. Some of the many application areas of such problems include information retrieval, sub-circuit identification, chemical structure classification, and networks. Problems of efficient graph matching arise in any field that may be modeled with graphs. For example, any problem that can be modeled with binary relations between entities in the domain is such a problem. The individual entities in the problem domain become nodes in the graph. And each binary relation becomes an edge between the appropriate nodes. Although it is possible to formulate such a large array of problems as graph matching problems, it is not necessarily a good idea to do so. Graph matching is a very difficult problem. The graph isomorphism problem is to determine if there exists a one-to-one mapping from the nodes of one graph to the nodes of a second graph that preserves adjacency. Similarly, the subgraph isomorphism problem is to determine if there exists a one-to-one mapping from the nodes of a given graph to the nodes of a subgraph of a second graph that preserves adjacency. The largest common subgraph problem is to find the largest subgraphs of two given graphs such that the subgraphs are isomorphic. The digraph D-morphism problem is to determine if there exists a one-to-one mapping from the nodes of one directed graph to the nodes of a second directed graph that preserves adjacency if you disregard the directions of the arcs. The closely related problems of subgraph isomorphism, largest common subgraph, and digraph D-morphism are known to be NP-complete. Whether or not the graph isomorphism problem is in the class of NP-complete problems is an open question. Although there do exist special cases of each of these problems that can be solved in polynomial time, there do not exist known algorithms of polynomial complexity to solve these problems in the general case. Therefore, the search for more efficient solutions to these problems is of great importance.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello1999drexel.html"},

Abstract Nearly all major commercial computer-aided design systems have adopted a feature-based design approach to solid modeling. Models are created via a sequence of operations which apply design features to incremental versions of a design model. Even surfacing, free-form surface shaping, and deformation operations are internally represented in modeling systems as features in a \"history tree\" that generates the final design. Much in the same manner that Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) trees for an individual model can be non-unique, these design feature histories for solid models might be ordered in a number of ways and still result in the same final geometry and topology. We formulate this problem symbolically and present geometric reasoning techniques to generate a canonical form for certain classes of design feature histories. We define this representation as a Model Dependency Graph (MDG) and show how it can be used as a basis for developing techniques for managing databases of solid models. Using the MDG, we introduce algorithms that can assess the similarity of solid models based on design features. One of these algorithms computes an approximation to the subgraph isomorphism and graph isomorphism problems using a random restart gradient descent approach. Another of these algorithms uses the search method known as A* to detect subgraph isomorphism. We believe these techniques can be used to build intelligent CAD knowledge-bases and to identify meaningful part families from large sets of designs. Lastly, we describe experimental results and performance metrics for our approach.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello1999sigxi.html"},

Even surfacing, free-form surface shaping, and deformation operations are internally represented in modeling systems as features in a \"history tree\" that generates the final design. Much in the same manner that Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) trees for an individual model can be non-unique, these design feature histories for solid models might be ordered in a number of ways and still result in the same final geometry and topology. We formulate this problem symbolically and present geometric reasoning techniques to generate a canonical form for certain classes of design feature histories. We define this representation as a Model Dependency Graph (MDG) and show how it can be used as a basis for developing techniques for managing databases of solid models. Using the MDG, we introduce algorithms that can assess the similarity of solid models based on design features. We believe these techniques can be used to build intelligent CAD knowledge-bases and to identify meaningful part families from large sets of designs. Lastly, we describe experimental results and performance metrics for our approach.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/sm99-paper.pdf"},

Smith In Using Uncertainty Within Computation: Papers from the 2001 AAAI Fall Symposium, pages 30-37. AAAI Press, November 2001. Abstract The factory is a complex dynamic environment and scheduling operations for such an environment is a challenging problem. In practice, dispatch scheduling policies are commonly employed, as they offer an efficient and robust solution. However, dispatch scheduling policies are generally myopic, and as such they are susceptible to sub-optimal decision-making. In this paper, we attempt to improve upon results of such dispatch policies by introducing non-determinism into the decision-making process, and instead using a given policy as a baseline for biasing stochastic decisions. We consider the problem of weighted tardiness scheduling with sequence-dependent setups with unknown arrival times in a dynamic environment, and show that randomization of state-of-the-art dispatch heuristics for this problem in this manner can improve performance. Furthermore, we find that the \"easier\" the problem, the less benefit there is from randomization; the \"harder\" the problem, the more benefit. Our method of randomization is based on a model of the way colonies of wasps self-organize social hierarchies in nature.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2001aaaifa.html"},

Cicirello and Stephen F. Smith In Using Uncertainty Within Computation: Papers from the 2001 AAAI Fall Symposium, pages 30-37. AAAI Press, November 2001. Abstract The factory is a complex dynamic environment and scheduling operations for such an environment is a challenging problem. In practice, dispatch scheduling policies are commonly employed, as they offer an efficient and robust solution. However, dispatch scheduling policies are generally myopic, and as such they are susceptible to sub-optimal decision-making. In this paper, we attempt to improve upon results of such dispatch policies by introducing non-determinism into the decision-making process, and instead using a given policy as a baseline for biasing stochastic decisions. We consider the problem of weighted tardiness scheduling with sequence-dependent setups with unknown arrival times in a dynamic environment, and show that randomization of state-of-the-art dispatch heuristics for this problem in this manner can improve performance. Furthermore, we find that the \"easier\" the problem, the less benefit there is from randomization; the \"harder\" the problem, the more benefit. Our method of randomization is based on a model of the way colonies of wasps self-organize social hierarchies in nature.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/FS01-04-004.pdf"},

Cicirello and Stephen F. Smith In ISADS-2001: Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems, pages 383-390. IEEE Computer Society Press, March 2001. Abstract We introduce a new approach to autonomous decentralized shop floor routing. Our system, which we call Ant Colony Control (AC2), applies the analogy of a colony of ants foraging for food to the problem of dynamic shop floor routing. In this system, artificial ants use only indirect communication to make all shop routing decisions by altering and reacting to their dynamically changing common environment through the use of simulated pheromone trails. For simple factory layouts, we show that the emergent behavior of the colony is comparable to using the optimal routing strategy. Furthermore, as the complexity of the factory layout is increased, we show that the adaptive behavior of AC2 evolves local decision making policies that lead to near-optimal solutions from the standpoint of global performance.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2001isads.html"},

"An Approach to a Feature-based Comparison of Solid Models of Machined Parts Vincent A. Cicirello and William C. Regli Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Design, Analysis and Manufacturing, 16(5):385-399, November 2002. Abstract Solid models are the critical data elements in modern computer-aided design environments, because they describe the shape and form of manufactured artifacts. Their growing ubiquity has created new problems in how to effectively manage the many models that are now stored in the digital libraries for large design and manufacturing enterprises. Existing techniques from the engineering literature and industrial practice, such as group technology, rely on human-supervised encodings and classification; techniques from the multimedia database and computer graphics/vision communities often ignore the manufacturing attributes that are most significant in the classification of models. This paper presents our approach to comparing the manufacturing similarity assessments of solid models of mechanical parts based on machining features. Our technical approach is threefold: perform machining feature extraction, construct a model dependency graph (MDG) from the set of machining features, and partition the models in a database using a measure of similarity based on the MDGs. We introduce two heuristic search techniques for comparing MDGs and present empirical experiments to validate our approach using our testbed, the National Design Repository.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/aiedam2002.16.5.pdf"},

Springer-Verlag, September 2002. Abstract Randomization as a means for improving search performance in combinatorial domains has received increasing interest in recent years. In optimization contexts, it can provide a means for overcoming the deficiencies of available search heuristics and broadening search in productive directions. In this paper, we consider the issue of amplifying the performance of a search heuristic through randomization. We introduce a general framework for embedding a base heuristic within an iterative sampling process and searching a stochastic neighborhood of the heuristic’s prescribed trajectory. In contrast to previous approaches, which have used rank-ordering as a basis for randomization, our approach instead relies on assigned heuristic value. Use of heuristic value is important because it makes it possible to vary the level of stochasticity in relation to the discriminatory power of the heuristic in different decision contexts, and hence concentrate search around those decisions where the heuristic is least informative. To evaluate the efficacy of the approach, we apply it to a complex, weighted-tardiness scheduling problem. Taking a state-of-the-art heuristic for this scheduling problem as a starting point, we demonstrate an ability to consistently and significantly improve on the deterministic heuristic solution across a broad range of problem instances. Our approach is also shown to consistently outperform a previously developed, rank-ordering based approach to randomizing the same heuristic in terms of percentage of improvement obtained.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2002cp.html"},

Abstract This report details a set of benchmark problem instances that we have generated for the weighted tardiness scheduling with sequence-dependent setups problem. The version of the problem without setup times is NP-Hard. The problem is further complicated by the sequence-dependent nature of the setups. Given that the weighted tardiness objective and the sequence-dependent setups constraint are both common real-world problem characteristics, and given the difficulty in solving this problem, we feel that it is currently under-represented in the research literature. With few algorithms currently available for the problem, this first benchmark problem set and initial results obtained via a large number of heuristic algorithms will hopefully encourage others to explore additional solutions to the problem.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2003cmu.html"},

with Sequence-Dependent Setups: A Benchmark Library Vincent A. Cicirello Technical Report, Intelligent Coordination and Logistics Laboratory, Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, February 2003. Abstract This report details a set of benchmark problem instances that we have generated for the weighted tardiness scheduling with sequence-dependent setups problem. The version of the problem without setup times is NP-Hard. The problem is further complicated by the sequence-dependent nature of the setups. Given that the weighted tardiness objective and the sequence-dependent setups constraint are both common real-world problem characteristics, and given the difficulty in solving this problem, we feel that it is currently under-represented in the research literature. With few algorithms currently available for the problem, this first benchmark problem set and initial results obtained via a large number of heuristic algorithms will hopefully encourage others to explore additional solutions to the problem.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/wtsbenchmarks.pdf"},

Cicirello PhD thesis, Ph.D. in Robotics, The Robotics Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, July 2003. Abstract In many combinatorial domains, simple stochastic algorithms often exhibit superior performance when compared to highly customized approaches. Many of these simple algorithms outperform more sophisticated approaches on difficult benchmark problems; and often lead to better solutions as the algorithms are taken out of the world of benchmarks and into the real-world. Simple stochastic algorithms are often robust, scalable problem solvers. This thesis explores methods for combining sets of heuristics within a single stochastic search. The ability of stochastic search to amplify heuristics is often a key factor in its success. Heuristics are not, however, infallible and in most domains no single heuristic dominates. It is therefore desirable to gain the collective power of a set of heuristics; and to design a search control framework capable of producing a hybrid algorithm from component heuristics with the ability to customize itself to a given problem instance. A primary goal is to explore what can be learned from quality distributions of iterative stochastic search in combinatorial optimization domains; and to exploit models of quality distributions to enhance the performance of stochastic problem solvers. We hypothesize that models of solution quality can lead to effective search control mechanisms, providing a general framework for combining multiple heuristics into an enhanced decision-making process. These goals lead to the development of a search control framework, called QD-BEACON, that uses online-generated statistical models of search performance to effectively combine search heuristics. A prerequisite goal is to develop a suitable stochastic sampling algorithm for combinatorial search problems. This goal leads to the development of an algorithm called VBSS that makes better use, in general, of the discriminatory power of a given search heuristic as compared to existing sampling approaches. The search frameworks of this thesis are evaluated on combinatorial optimization problems. Specifically, we show that: 1) VBSS is an effective method for amplifying heuristic performance for the weighted tardiness sequencing problem with sequence-dependent setups; 2) QD-BEACON can enhance the current best known algorithm for weighted tardiness sequencing; and 3) QD-BEACON and VBSS together provide the new best heuristic algorithm for the constrained optimization problem known as RCPSP/max.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2003thesis.html"},

Cicirello and Stephen F. Smith In Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming - CP 2004: 10th International Conference, Proceedings, volume LNCS 3258 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science, pages 197-211. Springer-Verlag, September/October 2004. Abstract The success of stochastic algorithms is often due to their ability to effectively amplify the performance of search heuristics. This is certainly the case with stochastic sampling algorithms such as heuristic-biased stochastic sampling (HBSS) and value-biased stochastic sampling (VBSS), wherein a heuristic is used to bias a stochastic policy for choosing among alternative branches in the search tree. One complication in getting the most out of algorithms like HBSS and VBSS in a given problem domain is the need to identify the most effective search heuristic. In many domains, the relative performance of various heuristics tends to vary across different problem instances and no single heuristic dominates. In such cases, the choice of any given heuristic will be limiting and it would be advantageous to gain the collective power of several heuristics. Toward this goal, this paper describes a framework for integrating multiple heuristics within a stochastic sampling search algorithm. In its essence, the framework uses online-generated statistical models of the search performance of different base heuristics to select which to employ on each subsequent iteration of the search. To estimate the solution quality distribution resulting from repeated application of a strong heuristic within a stochastic search, we propose the use of models from extreme value theory (EVT). Our EVT-motivated approach is validated on the NP-Hard problem of resource-constrained project scheduling with time windows (RCPSP/max). Using VBSS as a base stochastic sampling algorithm, the integrated use of a set of project scheduling heuristics is shown to be competitive with the current best known heuristic algorithm for RCPSP/max and in some cases even improves upon best known solutions to difficult benchmark instances.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2004cp.html"},

This is certainly the case with stochastic sampling algorithms such as heuristic-biased stochastic sampling (HBSS) and value-biased stochastic sampling (VBSS), wherein a heuristic is used to bias a stochastic policy for choosing among alternative branches in the search tree. One complication in getting the most out of algorithms like HBSS and VBSS in a given problem domain is the need to identify the most effective search heuristic. In many domains, the relative performance of various heuristics tends to vary across different problem instances and no single heuristic dominates. In such cases, the choice of any given heuristic will be limiting and it would be advantageous to gain the collective power of several heuristics. Toward this goal, this paper describes a framework for integrating multiple heuristics within a stochastic sampling search algorithm. In its essence, the framework uses online-generated statistical models of the search performance of different base heuristics to select which to employ on each subsequent iteration of the search. To estimate the solution quality distribution resulting from repeated application of a strong heuristic within a stochastic search, we propose the use of models from extreme value theory (EVT). Our EVT-motivated approach is validated on the NP-Hard problem of resource-constrained project scheduling with time windows (RCPSP/max). Using VBSS as a base stochastic sampling algorithm, the integrated use of a set of project scheduling heuristics is shown to be competitive with the current best known heuristic algorithm for RCPSP/max and in some cases even improves upon best known solutions to difficult benchmark instances.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/CP2004.pdf"},

February 2004. Invited Presentation. Abstract The Secure Wireless Agent Testbed (SWAT) is a unique facility developed at Drexel University in collaboration with Sarnoff Corporation to study integration, networking and information assurance for next-generation wireless mobile agent systems. It is the only known implemented system fully integrating: mobile agents, MANETs, and security. The authors believe that SWAT is the largest known multi-agent system living on a MANET (802.11b wireless network with ad hoc routing), consisting of dozens of mobile hosts (PDAs, laptops) and thousands of static and mobile software agents. Novel mechanisms have been developed for SWAT integrating autonomous agent technologies with public-key and symmetric key encryption to support secure communication, at multiple OSI layers, among groups of hosts and agents. SWAT Security is monitored by agents that manage keys, assess network traffic patterns and analyze host behaviors. Agents can use machine learning to develop profiles for nominal agent, hardware platform and network states. Given learned profiles, detection agents identify specific problems in SWAT, including over-runs/capture, and malicious insiders. Other agents monitor the health of the network and the devices in the network, looking for network attacks and security breaches. Using this framework, agents can revoke access rights for suspicious hosts or agents and adaptively re-route traffic at the network layer to improve the information integrity of the overall system. Agents also provide the implementation framework for decentralized user applications, including those for authentication, collaboration, messaging, and remote sensor monitoring.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2004darpa.html"},

Cicirello and Stephen F. Smith Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems, 8(3):237-266, May 2004. Abstract Agent-based approaches to manufacturing scheduling and control have gained increasing attention in recent years. Such approaches are attractive because they offer increased robustness against the unpredictability of factory operations. But the specification of local coordination policies that give rise to efficient global performance and effectively adapt to changing circumstances remains an interesting challenge. In this paper, we present a new approach to this coordination problem, drawing on various aspects of a computational model of how wasp colonies coordinate individual activities and allocate tasks to meet the collective needs of the nest. We focus specifically on the problem of configuring parallel multi-purpose machines in a factory to best satisfy product demands over time. Wasp-like computational agents that we call routing wasps act as overall machine proxies. These agents use a model of wasp task allocation behavior, coupled with a model of wasp dominance hierarchy formation, to determine which new jobs should be accepted into the machine’s queue. If you view our system from a market-oriented perspective, the policies that the routing wasps independently adapt for their respective machines can be likened to policies for deciding when to bid and when not to bid for arriving jobs. We benchmark the performance of our system on the real-world problem of assigning trucks to paint booths in a simulated vehicle paintshop. The objective of this problem is to minimize the number of paint color changes accrued by the system, assuming no a priori knowledge of the color sequence or color distribution of trucks arriving in the system. We demonstrate that our system outperforms the bidding mechanism originally implemented for the problem as well as another related adaptive bidding mechanism.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2004jaamas.html"},

In this paper, we present a new approach to this coordination problem, drawing on various aspects of a computational model of how wasp colonies coordinate individual activities and allocate tasks to meet the collective needs of the nest. We focus specifically on the problem of configuring parallel multi-purpose machines in a factory to best satisfy product demands over time. Wasp-like computational agents that we call routing wasps act as overall machine proxies. These agents use a model of wasp task allocation behavior, coupled with a model of wasp dominance hierarchy formation, to determine which new jobs should be accepted into the machine’s queue. If you view our system from a market-oriented perspective, the policies that the routing wasps independently adapt for their respective machines can be likened to policies for deciding when to bid and when not to bid for arriving jobs. We benchmark the performance of our system on the real-world problem of assigning trucks to paint booths in a simulated vehicle paintshop. The objective of this problem is to minimize the number of paint color changes accrued by the system, assuming no a priori knowledge of the color sequence or color distribution of trucks arriving in the system. We demonstrate that our system outperforms the bidding mechanism originally implemented for the problem as well as another related adaptive bidding mechanism.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/jaamas-8-3.pdf"},

Cicirello, William Regli, and Moshe Kam In Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE First Symposium on Multi-Agent Security and Survivability, pages 100-107. August 2004. Abstract Security of an agent system is often limited, relying on basic cryptographic techniques without consideration of issues such as key maintenance, forming and communicating in secure groups, or interlayer security. From a security engineering perspective, multi-agent systems introduce new channels and possibly layers, resulting in additional security concerns. A comprehensive security engineering perspective - studying the information flow of the multi-layered system, identifying, analyzing and addressing multi-level security threats - is rarely taken. This paper presents a security engineering process for multi-agent systems - motivating the need for comprehensive security engineering and showing how to proceed with the process within an agent system. One of the largest obstacles in security engineering is understanding how to decompose a system into the parts that require security. This paper provides a decomposition for agent systems that can be directly applied to the security engineering process.

Abstract Mobile ad hoc networks will form a critical part of the first-responder communications infrastructure. Empirical data shows how network-aware, autonomous, mobile agents can manage information services on live manet environments. A multidisciplinary team in Drexel University’s College of Engineering has been working with local law enforcement and transportation officials to identify problems in enabling police, fire, security, and other public protectors to effectively communicate and collaborate in first-response situations. Development of the Philadelphia Area Urban Wireless Network Testbed (PA-UWNT) is part of this effort. The PA-UWNT is a mobile ad hoc network (manet) comprising mobile computers (PDAs, tablets, and laptops) and Web service-based applications. Our experience in the PA-UWNT project indicates that constructing such systems will require new research developments in computer networking, agent and service-based computing, and security that integrate each of these disciplines at several fundamental levels. In this paper, we outline part of this approach through experiments demonstrating the utility of integrating the network and agent layers and enabling agents to reason about the current operating context. We posit that autonomous agents that can reason about the network’s slate and services offer an effective means of meeting the manet environment’s challenges.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2005ieeeis.html"},

Cicirello, Moshe Kam, and William Regli IEEE Intelligent Systems, 20(5):17-25, September/October 2005. Special Issue on Artificial Intelligence for Homeland Security. Abstract Mobile ad hoc networks will form a critical part of the first-responder communications infrastructure. Empirical data shows how network-aware, autonomous, mobile agents can manage information services on live manet environments. A multidisciplinary team in Drexel University’s College of Engineering has been working with local law enforcement and transportation officials to identify problems in enabling police, fire, security, and other public protectors to effectively communicate and collaborate in first-response situations. Development of the Philadelphia Area Urban Wireless Network Testbed (PA-UWNT) is part of this effort. The PA-UWNT is a mobile ad hoc network (manet) comprising mobile computers (PDAs, tablets, and laptops) and Web service-based applications. Our experience in the PA-UWNT project indicates that constructing such systems will require new research developments in computer networking, agent and service-based computing, and security that integrate each of these disciplines at several fundamental levels. In this paper, we outline part of this approach through experiments demonstrating the utility of integrating the network and agent layers and enabling agents to reason about the current operating context. We posit that autonomous agents that can reason about the network’s slate and services offer an effective means of meeting the manet environment’s challenges.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/IEEE-IS-2005.pdf"},

Cicirello In Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO'06), volume 2, pages 1125-1131. ACM Press, July 2006. Nominated for the Genetic Algorithms Track Best Paper Award. Abstract In this paper, we introduce a new crossover operator for the permutation representation of a GA. This new operator, Non-Wrapping Order Crossover (NWOX), is a variation of the well-known Order Crossover (OX) operator. It strongly preserves relative order, as does the original OX, but also respects the absolute positions within the parent permutations. This crossover operator is experimentally compared to several other permutation crossover operators on an NP-Hard problem known as weighted tardiness scheduling with sequence-dependent setups. A GA using this NWOX operator finds new best known solutions for several benchmark problem instances and proves to be superior to the previous best performing metaheuristic for the problem.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2006gecco.html"},

Specifically, we use the adaptive annealing schedule known as the modified Lam schedule to apply simulated annealing to the weighted tardiness scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setups. The modified Lam annealing schedule adjusts the temperature to track the theoretical optimal rate of accepted moves. Employing the modified Lam schedule allows us to avoid the often tedious tuning of the annealing schedule; as the algorithm tunes itself for each instance during problem solving. Our results show that an adaptive simulated annealer can be competitive when compared to highly tuned, hand crafted algorithms.

Today, almost every consumer grade wireless router comes with either \"out-of-the-box\" encryption or with relatively easy to follow instructions on how to properly secure the household wireless infrastructure. In this paper we investigate wireless technology and the implications related to the privacy of the average user.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/P-0017-final.pdf"},

Cicirello Technical Report, Richard Stockton College, Galloway, NJ, May 2008. Presented at the 40th Symposium on the Interface: Computing Science and Statistics (conference without proceedings), in Durham, NC, sponsored by the National Institute of Statistical Sciences. Full paper here as Technical Report. Abstract The complexity of many combinatorial optimization problems often preclude the application of exact problem solving techniques as the problem is scaled to real-world size. For example, for a problem that is NP-Hard in the strong sense, any algorithm that guarantees that its solutions are optimal is going to be limited in the size of the instance that it can solve given computational limitations. Rather than requiring \"optimal\" solutions, an alternative is to favor sufficiently good solutions that can be found efficiently. One approach to this uses a randomized heuristic algorithm. This paper specifically considers an algorithm known as Value Biased Stochastic Sampling (VBSS). VBSS uses a heuristic function to bias the random generation of a proposed solution to the problem. This process is repeated some number of times and retains only the best solution found over several trials. The key to the effectiveness of VBSS is the choice of the heuristic function. The job of the heuristic function is to provide problem dependent evaluation of the choices that can be made. This evaluation is used to bias the random decisions during the problem solving process. At the time of the design of such an algorithm, it may not be obvious which of several heuristics are best. During the past few years, we have been developing techniques for allowing VBSS to self-select which heuristic to use. Our approach relies on modeling the distribution of the quality of solutions obtained by VBSS over its allocated set of restarts. This paper presents some of our analysis of potential models, including goodness of fit tests for several possible assumptions we can make about the distribution of the quality of solutions. Our analysis leads us to the selection of the Generalized Extreme Value Distribution for our models of randomized heuristic performance.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2008rsc.html"},

Cicirello In Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference, FLAIRS-23, pages 14-19. AAAI Press, May 2010. Abstract Dispatch scheduling policies offer a computationally inexpensive approach to many scheduling problems as an alternative to more processor intensive search algorithms. They are especially useful in dynamic situations where problem solving may be temporally constrained. However, dispatch heuristics have also been effectively used for guidance within more intensive search algorithms, expanding their applicability well beyond simple myopic job or task selection. In this paper, we present a new crossover operator for genetic algorithms (GA) where a permutation representation is employed. Our new operator directly integrates problem-dependent knowledge in the form of a dispatch scheduling policy into the crossover step of a GA which is usually a problem-independent recombination. Our novel crossover operator, Heuristic Sequencing Crossover (HeurX), recombines elements of M parents into a single child and is specifically designed for steady-state GAs. We empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on a strongly NP-Hard scheduling problem known as Weighted Tardiness Scheduling with Sequence-Dependent Setups. We compare our approach to a generational GA using a problem-independent crossover operator. We show the potential power of integrating problem-dependent knowledge via a dispatch heuristic into what is traditionally a problem independent problem solver.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2010flairs.html"},

Genetic Algorithm Vincent A. Cicirello In Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference, FLAIRS-23, pages 14-19. AAAI Press, May 2010. Abstract Dispatch scheduling policies offer a computationally inexpensive approach to many scheduling problems as an alternative to more processor intensive search algorithms. They are especially useful in dynamic situations where problem solving may be temporally constrained. However, dispatch heuristics have also been effectively used for guidance within more intensive search algorithms, expanding their applicability well beyond simple myopic job or task selection. In this paper, we present a new crossover operator for genetic algorithms (GA) where a permutation representation is employed. Our new operator directly integrates problem-dependent knowledge in the form of a dispatch scheduling policy into the crossover step of a GA which is usually a problem-independent recombination. Our novel crossover operator, Heuristic Sequencing Crossover (HeurX), recombines elements of M parents into a single child and is specifically designed for steady-state GAs. We empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on a strongly NP-Hard scheduling problem known as Weighted Tardiness Scheduling with Sequence-Dependent Setups. We compare our approach to a generational GA using a problem-independent crossover operator. We show the potential power of integrating problem-dependent knowledge via a dispatch heuristic into what is traditionally a problem independent problem solver.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/FLAIRS2010.pdf"},

The activity is based on the well-known Bin Packing problem, and is specifically an extension of an existing active learning exercise known as Collective Bin Packing but adapted to the online classroom. The activity is designed for an undergraduate interdisciplinary course as part of a liberal arts curriculum.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello-ccscne2013-unplugged.pdf"},

Cicirello arXiv preprint arXiv:1708.05264 [cs.DC], August 2017. Abstract In this report, I describe the design and implementation of an inexpensive, eight node, 32 core, cluster of raspberry pi single board computers, as well as the performance of this cluster on two computational tasks, one that requires significant data transfer relative to computational time requirements, and one that does not. We have two use-cases for the cluster: (a) as an educational tool for classroom usage, such as covering parallel algorithms in an algorithms course; and (b) as a test system for use during the development of parallel metaheuristics, essentially serving as a personal desktop parallel computing cluster. Our preliminary results show that the slow 100 Mbps networking of the raspberry pi significantly limits such clusters to parallel computational tasks that are either long running relative to data communications requirements, or that which requires very little internode communications. Additionally, although the raspberry pi 3 has a quad-core processor, parallel speedup degrades during attempts to utilize all four cores of all cluster nodes for a parallel computation, likely due to resource contention with operating system level processes. However, distributing a task across three cores of each cluster node does enable linear (or near linear) speedup.

Abstract In this report, I describe the design and implementation of an inexpensive, eight node, 32 core, cluster of raspberry pi single board computers, as well as the performance of this cluster on two computational tasks, one that requires significant data transfer relative to computational time requirements, and one that does not. We have two use-cases for the cluster: (a) as an educational tool for classroom usage, such as covering parallel algorithms in an algorithms course; and (b) as a test system for use during the development of parallel metaheuristics, essentially serving as a personal desktop parallel computing cluster. Our preliminary results show that the slow 100 Mbps networking of the raspberry pi significantly limits such clusters to parallel computational tasks that are either long running relative to data communications requirements, or that which requires very little internode communications.

Cicirello In Proceedings of the Tenth International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS 2017), pages 2-10. AAAI Press, June 2017. Abstract In this paper, we propose: (a) a restart schedule for an adaptive simulated annealer, and (b) parallel simulated annealing, with an adaptive and parameter-free annealing schedule. The foundation of our approach is the Modified Lam annealing schedule, which adaptively controls the temperature parameter to track a theoretically ideal rate of acceptance of neighboring states. A sequential implementation of Modified Lam simulated annealing is almost parameter-free. However, it requires prior knowledge of the annealing length. We eliminate this parameter using restarts, with an exponentially increasing schedule of annealing lengths. We then extend this restart schedule to parallel implementation, executing several Modified Lam simulated annealers in parallel, with varying initial annealing lengths, and our proposed parallel annealing length schedule. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on an NP-Hard scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup constraints. We compare our approach to fixed length restarts, both sequentially and in parallel. Our results show that our approach can achieve substantial performance gains, throughout the course of the run, demonstrating our approach to be an effective anytime algorithm.

Getting these control parameters \"right\" is often critical to search performance. My research in this area includes both automated parameter tuning, as well as self-adaptive metahueristics or automated parameter control. My research in this area also includes multi-heuristic search. Some forms of search require the guidance of a heuristic, and the \"best\" heuristic for a problem may vary widely from that of another problem, or may even vary across instances of a problem.

I explore both theoretical and applied topics in these areas, with a particular interest in how theory impacts practice. Current and past application domains for my research include scheduling and planning, coordination and logistics, computer-aided engineering, and manufacturing. I also, on occasion, conduct research on computer science education topics. Search Landscape Analysis Recently, I have been exploring the fitness landscapes of permutation optimization problems, problems where one must find an optimal ordering of some discrete set (e.g., scheduling problems). Such permutation problems fall into one of three broad categories, depending upon the structural characteristics of greatest influence on solution fitness (absolute positioning of elements, relative positioning of elements, or element precedences), although some problems may span more than one of these categories. Among other things, my research on permutation fitness landscapes has introduced a theoretical framework enabling exploring the effects of these structural properties on search performance. This includes the \"Permutation in a Haystack\" problem which enables specifying permutation fitness landscapes; as well as the \"Calculus of Search Landscapes\", a new tool for search landscape analysis that focuses on rates of change of fitness landscape topology, complementing other search landscape analysis tools such as fitness-distance correlation.

Topics related to software dependability and security engineering are also covered. CSIS 4481: Cryptography and Data Security (Last taught: Fall 2016, Syllabus): Cryptography has become an essential tool for data security. It is used to provide data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It supports the authentication of data and protection of privacy. However, cryptography is only one component of a security system. There are hardware, software engineering, social and political issues that also must be considered. This course provides a broad view of security with practical applications of cryptography to data security. Specific topics include classical and modern encryption techniques, steganography, and human factors. CSIS 4466: Computer Graphics (Last taught: Fall 2015, Syllabus): This course provides an introduction to 2D and 3D computer graphics including the study of hardware, software, algorithms, modeling, rendering, and applications. Topics will be introduced using the Java 2D and 3D APIs. CSIS 4463: Artificial Intelligence (Last taught: Spring 2017, Syllabus): A study of tools, techniques, and applications associated with intelligent computer systems. The course will include topics from classical symbolic AI as well as topics from computational intelligence. Topics will include intelligent problem-solving methods, knowledge representation, heuristics, genetic algorithms, and selected topics from machine learning. Counts as an elective for the Minor in Behavioral Neuroscience. CSIS 4104: Data Structures and Algorithms II (Last taught: Fall 2017, Syllabus): In this course, students deepen their knowledge of the design and analysis of computer algorithms. Advanced topics in algorithms and algorithm analysis covered in the course include graphs and graph algorithms, string matching, multi-threaded algorithms, and NP-completeness. Taught using Python. CSIS 3103: Data Structures and Algorithms I (Last taught: Spring 2017, Syllabus): Advanced topics in the specification, implementation, and use of important data structures and associated algorithms.

GNM 2248: Artificial Intelligence in Society (Last taught: Spring 2017, Syllabus): This course will provide a broad overview and introduction to the field of artificial intelligence (AI) focusing on the impacts it has made on society during the past 50 years. The intended audience for this course is that of the general student. No mathematical background is required. The course will begin by providing a broad overview of what AI is, and what it is not, including a discussion of the notions of Strong and Weak AI. Strong AI hypothesizes that the human mind is nothing more than a computational device and thus that computers can in principle be programmed with the capability of thought (i.e., to truly reason and solve problems). Contrast this with Weak AI which does not focus on whether machines can be made to actually think, but rather whether machines can be made to act intelligently. We will read and discuss articles by the pioneering scientists and philosophers that explore these notions. Next, the course will focus on introducing the student to applications of AI that have been making their ways into our everyday lives. Attention will be placed on the ethical issues and the impacts AI technology will continue to make on society. The course will include a combination of lectures, class discussion of films (both fiction and non-fiction) and assigned readings (both non-fiction and fiction), as well as current day news articles. Counts as an elective for the Minor in Behavioral Neuroscience. Fulfills university's Historically Conscious (H) requirement, and offered as a Writing Across the Curriculum (W2) course.
