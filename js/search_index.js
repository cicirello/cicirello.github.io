What you need: Eight (8) raspberry pis in standard raspberry pi cases, along with any relevant cables for power and networking. Two (2) napkin holders of the type where napkins are stacked. Must have openings in sides, such as the steel lattice design that I used here. A bag of cable/zip ties (I used 16 total). Step 1: Zip up the napkin weight Use cable/zip ties to hold up the napkin weight on one of the napkin holders so that it is approximately level with the sides of the napkin holder. Step 2: Attach the second napkin holder The napkin holders that I used have feet that prevent aligning directly atop each other. Rotate the second napkin holder 45 degrees relative to the first. Use cable ties to attach. Make sure you use enough cable ties sufficiently tightened to ensure that the top napkin holder won't move. Specifically, use two cable ties on each of the three corners that come into contact with the bottom napkin holder. Additionally, use one cable tie to attach the napkin weight of the bottom holder to the bottom of the top holder. Step 3: Trim the cable ties Well, do what the heading of this step says. Step 4: Zip the napkin weight to create a shelf Use cable ties to prop up the napkin weight of the top napkin holder. I connected three cable ties in sequence to span the width of the napkin holder both below and above the napkin weight. I repeated this a couple inches away creating a shelf, which I'm using to hold a network switch. Step 5: Arrange your Raspberry Pis and Route Cables Each napkin holder is large enough for four raspberry pis in standard cases, each rotated such that ports are accessible via two sides at the corners. If you're using wired networking, you can sit a switch on top of the shelf you created in step 4. I'm using a couple phone chargers as a power source. I currently have them simply sitting next to the rack. Route your power and network cables through the lattice sides of the napkin holders. I used 3 foot long cables, which is partially to blame for the messy wiring in the photo. One foot length cables would be better (and neater). The cable routing will also turn out better if you are more patient than I am.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/howto/pirack/"},

He is a member of AAAI (Life member), ACM (Senior Member), ACM SIGCSE, ACM SIGAI, ACM SIGEVO, CCSC, IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, IEEE Computational Intelligence Society, and SIAM. Prior to joining the Stockton University faculty, Dr. Cicirello worked as a Research Scientist for Drexel University (2003-2005) at Drexel's Applied Communications and Information Networking (ACIN) Center in Camden, NJ as part of an interdisciplinary team from Drexel's Computer Science Department and Electrical Engineering Department developing the Secure Wireless Agent Testbed. During a 2012 sabbatical from Stockton University, Dr. Cicirello collaborated with Drexel's Geometric and Intelligent Computing Laboratory (GICL), as a Visiting Associate Professor, on research related to digital engineering data management. He earned a Ph.D. in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University in 2003. While a Ph.D. student in CMU's Robotics Institute from 1999 to 2003, Vince's research included applications of swarm intelligence, research in applying machine learning to the control of metaheuristics, as well as multi-agent/multi-robot coordination. Vince's dissertation research was applied to industrial scheduling problems as well as robotic space exploration. One outcome of his dissertation research is a paper published and presented at the 2005 National Conference on Artificial Intelligence for which Vincent Cicirello, and his co-author and dissertation adviser Steve Smith, were awarded the 2005 AAAI Outstanding Paper Award. As part of a dual M.S./B.S. program, he earned a M.S. in Computer Science, a B.S. in Computer Science, and a B.S. in Mathematics from Drexel University in 1999.

Abstract Nearly all major commercial computer-aided design systems have adopted a feature-based design approach to solid modeling. Models are created via a sequence of operations which apply design features to incremental versions of a design model. Even surfacing, free-form surface shaping, and deformation operations are internally represented in modeling systems as features in a \"history tree\" that generates the final design. Much in the same manner that Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) trees for an individual model can be non-unique, these design feature histories for solid models might be ordered in a number of ways and still result in the same final geometry and topology. We formulate this problem symbolically and present geometric reasoning techniques to generate a canonical form for certain classes of design feature histories. We define this representation as a Model Dependency Graph (MDG) and show how it can be used as a basis for developing techniques for managing databases of solid models. Using the MDG, we introduce algorithms that can assess the similarity of solid models based on design features. One of these algorithms computes an approximation to the subgraph isomorphism and graph isomorphism problems using a random restart gradient descent approach. Another of these algorithms uses the search method known as A* to detect subgraph isomorphism. We believe these techniques can be used to build intelligent CAD knowledge-bases and to identify meaningful part families from large sets of designs. Lastly, we describe experimental results and performance metrics for our approach.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello1999sigxi.html"},

Another of these algorithms uses the search method known as A* to detect subgraph isomorphism. It is believed that these techniques can be used to build intelligent CAD knowledge bases and to identify meaningful part families from large sets of designs. Lastly, experimental results and performance metrics for these approaches are described. It is shown empirically that although the worst case complexity of solutions to the subgraph isomorphism problem is exponential the described algorithms’ performance on random graphs and on the UMDG is tractable in practice.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello-thesis.pdf"},

Our system models the set of jobs queued in front of any given machine as a wasp nest, wherein wasp-like agents interact to form a social hierarchy and prioritize the jobs that they represent. Other wasp-like agents external to the nest act as overall machine proxies, and use a model of wasp task allocation behavior to determine which new jobs should be accepted into the machine’s queue.

In optimization contexts, it can provide a means for overcoming the deficiencies of available search heuristics and broadening search in productive directions. In this paper, we consider the issue of amplifying the performance of a search heuristic through randomization.

In contrast to previous approaches, which have used rank-ordering as a basis for randomization, our approach instead relies on assigned heuristic value. Use of heuristic value is important because it makes it possible to vary the level of stochasticity in relation to the discriminatory power of the heuristic in different decision contexts, and hence concentrate search around those decisions where the heuristic is least informative. To evaluate the efficacy of the approach, we apply it to a complex, weighted-tardiness scheduling problem. Taking a state-of-the-art heuristic for this scheduling problem as a starting point, we demonstrate an ability to consistently and significantly improve on the deterministic heuristic solution across a broad range of problem instances.

The version of the problem without setup times is NP-Hard. The problem is further complicated by the sequence-dependent nature of the setups.

Cicirello PhD thesis, Ph.D. in Robotics, The Robotics Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, July 2003. Abstract In many combinatorial domains, simple stochastic algorithms often exhibit superior performance when compared to highly customized approaches. Many of these simple algorithms outperform more sophisticated approaches on difficult benchmark problems; and often lead to better solutions as the algorithms are taken out of the world of benchmarks and into the real-world. Simple stochastic algorithms are often robust, scalable problem solvers. This thesis explores methods for combining sets of heuristics within a single stochastic search. The ability of stochastic search to amplify heuristics is often a key factor in its success. Heuristics are not, however, infallible and in most domains no single heuristic dominates. It is therefore desirable to gain the collective power of a set of heuristics; and to design a search control framework capable of producing a hybrid algorithm from component heuristics with the ability to customize itself to a given problem instance. A primary goal is to explore what can be learned from quality distributions of iterative stochastic search in combinatorial optimization domains; and to exploit models of quality distributions to enhance the performance of stochastic problem solvers. We hypothesize that models of solution quality can lead to effective search control mechanisms, providing a general framework for combining multiple heuristics into an enhanced decision-making process. These goals lead to the development of a search control framework, called QD-BEACON, that uses online-generated statistical models of search performance to effectively combine search heuristics. A prerequisite goal is to develop a suitable stochastic sampling algorithm for combinatorial search problems. This goal leads to the development of an algorithm called VBSS that makes better use, in general, of the discriminatory power of a given search heuristic as compared to existing sampling approaches.

This is certainly the case with stochastic sampling algorithms such as heuristic-biased stochastic sampling (HBSS) and value-biased stochastic sampling (VBSS), wherein a heuristic is used to bias a stochastic policy for choosing among alternative branches in the search tree.

In such cases, the choice of any given heuristic will be limiting and it would be advantageous to gain the collective power of several heuristics. Toward this goal, this paper describes a framework for integrating multiple heuristics within a stochastic sampling search algorithm. In its essence, the framework uses online-generated statistical models of the search performance of different base heuristics to select which to employ on each subsequent iteration of the search. To estimate the solution quality distribution resulting from repeated application of a strong heuristic within a stochastic search, we propose the use of models from extreme value theory (EVT). Our EVT-motivated approach is validated on the NP-Hard problem of resource-constrained project scheduling with time windows (RCPSP/max). Using VBSS as a base stochastic sampling algorithm, the integrated use of a set of project scheduling heuristics is shown to be competitive with the current best known heuristic algorithm for RCPSP/max and in some cases even improves upon best known solutions to difficult benchmark instances.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2004cp.html"},

February 2004. Invited Presentation. Abstract The Secure Wireless Agent Testbed (SWAT) is a unique facility developed at Drexel University in collaboration with Sarnoff Corporation to study integration, networking and information assurance for next-generation wireless mobile agent systems. It is the only known implemented system fully integrating: mobile agents, MANETs, and security. The authors believe that SWAT is the largest known multi-agent system living on a MANET (802.11b wireless network with ad hoc routing), consisting of dozens of mobile hosts (PDAs, laptops) and thousands of static and mobile software agents. Novel mechanisms have been developed for SWAT integrating autonomous agent technologies with public-key and symmetric key encryption to support secure communication, at multiple OSI layers, among groups of hosts and agents. SWAT Security is monitored by agents that manage keys, assess network traffic patterns and analyze host behaviors. Agents can use machine learning to develop profiles for nominal agent, hardware platform and network states. Given learned profiles, detection agents identify specific problems in SWAT, including over-runs/capture, and malicious insiders. Other agents monitor the health of the network and the devices in the network, looking for network attacks and security breaches. Using this framework, agents can revoke access rights for suspicious hosts or agents and adaptively re-route traffic at the network layer to improve the information integrity of the overall system. Agents also provide the implementation framework for decentralized user applications, including those for authentication, collaboration, messaging, and remote sensor monitoring.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello2004darpa.html"},

This motivates an exploration strategy that follows a Boltzmann distribution with an exponentially decaying temperature parameter.

Our experience in the PA-UWNT project indicates that constructing such systems will require new research developments in computer networking, agent and service-based computing, and security that integrate each of these disciplines at several fundamental levels. In this paper, we outline part of this approach through experiments demonstrating the utility of integrating the network and agent layers and enabling agents to reason about the current operating context. We posit that autonomous agents that can reason about the network’s slate and services offer an effective means of meeting the manet environment’s challenges.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/IEEE-IS-2005.pdf"},

Cicirello Technical Report, Richard Stockton College, Galloway, NJ, May 2008. Presented at the 40th Symposium on the Interface: Computing Science and Statistics (conference without proceedings), in Durham, NC, sponsored by the National Institute of Statistical Sciences. Full paper here as Technical Report. Abstract The complexity of many combinatorial optimization problems often preclude the application of exact problem solving techniques as the problem is scaled to real-world size. For example, for a problem that is NP-Hard in the strong sense, any algorithm that guarantees that its solutions are optimal is going to be limited in the size of the instance that it can solve given computational limitations. Rather than requiring \"optimal\" solutions, an alternative is to favor sufficiently good solutions that can be found efficiently. One approach to this uses a randomized heuristic algorithm. This paper specifically considers an algorithm known as Value Biased Stochastic Sampling (VBSS). VBSS uses a heuristic function to bias the random generation of a proposed solution to the problem. This process is repeated some number of times and retains only the best solution found over several trials. The key to the effectiveness of VBSS is the choice of the heuristic function. The job of the heuristic function is to provide problem dependent evaluation of the choices that can be made. This evaluation is used to bias the random decisions during the problem solving process. At the time of the design of such an algorithm, it may not be obvious which of several heuristics are best. During the past few years, we have been developing techniques for allowing VBSS to self-select which heuristic to use. Our approach relies on modeling the distribution of the quality of solutions obtained by VBSS over its allocated set of restarts.

Cicirello Technical Report, Richard Stockton College, Galloway, NJ, May 2008. Presented at the 40th Symposium on the Interface: Computing Science and Statistics (conference without proceedings), in Durham, NC, sponsored by the National Institute of Statistical Sciences. Full paper here as Technical Report. Abstract The complexity of many combinatorial optimization problems often preclude the application of exact problem solving techniques as the problem is scaled to real-world size. For example, for a problem that is NP-Hard in the strong sense, any algorithm that guarantees that its solutions are optimal is going to be limited in the size of the instance that it can solve given computational limitations. Rather than requiring \"optimal\" solutions, an alternative is to favor sufficiently good solutions that can be found efficiently. One approach to this uses a randomized heuristic algorithm. This paper specifically considers an algorithm known as Value Biased Stochastic Sampling (VBSS). VBSS uses a heuristic function to bias the random generation of a proposed solution to the problem. This process is repeated some number of times and retains only the best solution found over several trials. The key to the effectiveness of VBSS is the choice of the heuristic function. The job of the heuristic function is to provide problem dependent evaluation of the choices that can be made. This evaluation is used to bias the random decisions during the problem solving process. At the time of the design of such an algorithm, it may not be obvious which of several heuristics are best. During the past few years, we have been developing techniques for allowing VBSS to self-select which heuristic to use. Our approach relies on modeling the distribution of the quality of solutions obtained by VBSS over its allocated set of restarts. This paper presents some of our analysis of potential models, including goodness of fit tests for several possible assumptions we can make about the distribution of the quality of solutions. Our analysis leads us to the selection of the Generalized Extreme Value Distribution for our models of randomized heuristic performance.", "url": "https://www.cicirello.org/publications/cicirello-stockton-2008.pdf"},

Cicirello In Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research Society Conference, FLAIRS-23, pages 14-19. AAAI Press, May 2010. Abstract Dispatch scheduling policies offer a computationally inexpensive approach to many scheduling problems as an alternative to more processor intensive search algorithms. They are especially useful in dynamic situations where problem solving may be temporally constrained. However, dispatch heuristics have also been effectively used for guidance within more intensive search algorithms, expanding their applicability well beyond simple myopic job or task selection. In this paper, we present a new crossover operator for genetic algorithms (GA) where a permutation representation is employed. Our new operator directly integrates problem-dependent knowledge in the form of a dispatch scheduling policy into the crossover step of a GA which is usually a problem-independent recombination. Our novel crossover operator, Heuristic Sequencing Crossover (HeurX), recombines elements of M parents into a single child and is specifically designed for steady-state GAs. We empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on a strongly NP-Hard scheduling problem known as Weighted Tardiness Scheduling with Sequence-Dependent Setups. We compare our approach to a generational GA using a problem-independent crossover operator.

Cicirello Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, 28(6):162-168, June 2013. Abstract In this paper, we present a group, asynchronous problem solving exercise designed to introduce non-computer science students to a variety of concepts from artificial intelligence and operations research. The exercise is designed to be a Computer Science (CS) Unplugged activity suitable for the online classroom. CS Unplugged is a methodology for teaching CS concepts using hands-on interactive activities without using a computer. CS Unplugged activities are often used to introduce CS concepts to novices, such as elementary, middle, or high school students; but can also be effective at engaging the non-CS undergraduate student.

Abstract In this paper, we propose: (a) a restart schedule for an adaptive simulated annealer, and (b) parallel simulated annealing, with an adaptive and parameter-free annealing schedule. The foundation of our approach is the Modified Lam annealing schedule, which adaptively controls the temperature parameter to track a theoretically ideal rate of acceptance of neighboring states. A sequential implementation of Modified Lam simulated annealing is almost parameter-free. However, it requires prior knowledge of the annealing length. We eliminate this parameter using restarts, with an exponentially increasing schedule of annealing lengths. We then extend this restart schedule to parallel implementation, executing several Modified Lam simulated annealers in parallel, with varying initial annealing lengths, and our proposed parallel annealing length schedule. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on an NP-Hard scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup constraints. We compare our approach to fixed length restarts, both sequentially and in parallel. Our results show that our approach can achieve substantial performance gains, throughout the course of the run, demonstrating our approach to be an effective anytime algorithm.

The foundation of our approach is the Modified Lam annealing schedule, which adaptively controls the temperature parameter to track a theoretically ideal rate of acceptance of neighboring states. A sequential implementation of Modified Lam simulated annealing is almost parameter-free. However, it requires prior knowledge of the annealing length. We eliminate this parameter using restarts, with an exponentially increasing schedule of annealing lengths. We then extend this restart schedule to parallel implementation, executing several Modified Lam simulated annealers in parallel, with varying initial annealing lengths, and our proposed parallel annealing length schedule. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on an NP-Hard scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup constraints. We compare our approach to fixed length restarts, both sequentially and in parallel. Our results show that our approach can achieve substantial performance gains, throughout the course of the run, demonstrating our approach to be an effective anytime algorithm.

I explore both theoretical and applied topics in these areas, with a particular interest in how theory impacts practice. Current and past application domains for my research include scheduling and planning, coordination and logistics, computer-aided engineering, and manufacturing. I also, on occasion, conduct research on computer science education topics. Search Landscape Analysis Recently, I have been exploring the fitness landscapes of permutation optimization problems, problems where one must find an optimal ordering of some discrete set (e.g., scheduling problems). Such permutation problems fall into one of three broad categories, depending upon the structural characteristics of greatest influence on solution fitness (absolute positioning of elements, relative positioning of elements, or element precedences), although some problems may span more than one of these categories. Among other things, my research on permutation fitness landscapes has introduced a theoretical framework enabling exploring the effects of these structural properties on search performance. This includes the \"Permutation in a Haystack\" problem which enables specifying permutation fitness landscapes; as well as the \"Calculus of Search Landscapes\", a new tool for search landscape analysis that focuses on rates of change of fitness landscape topology, complementing other search landscape analysis tools such as fitness-distance correlation.

Some forms of search require the guidance of a heuristic, and the \"best\" heuristic for a problem may vary widely from that of another problem, or may even vary across instances of a problem. Some of my research has applied machine learning to enabling metaheuristics to adapt their choice of heuristic. More info, including selected relevant publications.... Genetic Operators for Permutation Representation The permutation representation for genetic algorithms requires specialized operators. A wide variety of crossover and mutation operators for permutations exist in the research literature. In my research on evolutionary computation for optimizing permutation structures, I have developed several crossover and mutation operators, including Non-Wrapping Order Crossover (NWOX), Uniform Partially Matched Crossover (UPMX), Heuristic Sequencing Crossover (HeurX), and window-limited variations of common permutation mutation operators. More info, including selected relevant publications.... Metaheuristic Development My research has lead to the development of new metaheuristics, including Value-Biased Stochastic Sampling (VBSS), and Wasp Behavior Inspired Stochastic Sampling (WHISTLING). More info, including selected relevant publications.... Swarm Intelligence Swarm intelligence refers to multiagent systems whose behavior is motivated by models of naturally occurring swarming systems, such as social insect swarms (e.g., ants, wasps, etc). My past research in this area includes applications of models of wasp task allocation and wasp social hierarchy formation to industrial scheduling and coordination problems, as well as multirobot coordination in space exploration. I have also explored applications of swarming agents to data management and network monitoring on mobile ad hoc networks. More info, including selected relevant publications.... Multi-Agent Systems / Multi-Robot Systems Although much of my research on multiagent / multirobot systems is specifically related to swarm intelligence, I have additionally conducted research related to other aspects of these systems, including market-based coordination, security engineering of multiagent systems, issues related to mobile agents on ad hoc wireless networks, power aware agents, and multiagent collaboration tools. More info, including selected relevant publications.... Applications of AI to Computer-Aided Engineering My research also includes applications of artificial intelligence to problems within the broad domain of Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE). These problems are mostly related to data management in large engineering digital libraries, such as automated engineering format classification, and search and retrieval of engineering artifacts, such as Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models based upon structural similarity. More info, including selected relevant publications....

Such permutation problems fall into one of three broad categories, depending upon the structural characteristics of greatest influence on solution fitness (absolute positioning of elements, relative positioning of elements, or element precedences), although some problems may span more than one of these categories. Among other things, my research on permutation fitness landscapes has introduced a theoretical framework enabling exploring the effects of these structural properties on search performance. This includes the \"Permutation in a Haystack\" problem which enables specifying permutation fitness landscapes; as well as the \"Calculus of Search Landscapes\", a new tool for search landscape analysis that focuses on rates of change of fitness landscape topology, complementing other search landscape analysis tools such as fitness-distance correlation.

The course addresses universal software engineering techniques as well as techniques for development of critical software systems where the cost of system failure is potentially high. Software engineering topics covered will include software process models, agile software development methods, requirements engineering, system modeling, architectural design, implementation, software testing, and evolution. Topics related to software dependability and security engineering are also covered. CSIS 4481: Cryptography and Data Security (Last taught: Fall 2016, Syllabus): Cryptography has become an essential tool for data security. It is used to provide data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It supports the authentication of data and protection of privacy. However, cryptography is only one component of a security system. There are hardware, software engineering, social and political issues that also must be considered. This course provides a broad view of security with practical applications of cryptography to data security. Specific topics include classical and modern encryption techniques, steganography, and human factors. CSIS 4466: Computer Graphics (Last taught: Fall 2015, Syllabus): This course provides an introduction to 2D and 3D computer graphics including the study of hardware, software, algorithms, modeling, rendering, and applications. Topics will be introduced using the Java 2D and 3D APIs. CSIS 4463: Artificial Intelligence (Last taught: Spring 2017, Syllabus): A study of tools, techniques, and applications associated with intelligent computer systems. The course will include topics from classical symbolic AI as well as topics from computational intelligence. Topics will include intelligent problem-solving methods, knowledge representation, heuristics, genetic algorithms, and selected topics from machine learning. Counts as an elective for the Minor in Behavioral Neuroscience. CSIS 4104: Data Structures and Algorithms II (Last taught: Fall 2017, Syllabus): In this course, students deepen their knowledge of the design and analysis of computer algorithms. Advanced topics in algorithms and algorithm analysis covered in the course include graphs and graph algorithms, string matching, multi-threaded algorithms, and NP-completeness. Taught using Python. CSIS 3103: Data Structures and Algorithms I (Last taught: Spring 2017, Syllabus): Advanced topics in the specification, implementation, and use of important data structures and associated algorithms. Data structures to be studied include stacks, queues, lists, trees, heaps, priority queues, sets/maps, and hash tables. Algorithm analysis is also studied, with emphasis on searching and sorting.

GNM 2248: Artificial Intelligence in Society (Last taught: Spring 2017, Syllabus): This course will provide a broad overview and introduction to the field of artificial intelligence (AI) focusing on the impacts it has made on society during the past 50 years. The intended audience for this course is that of the general student. No mathematical background is required. The course will begin by providing a broad overview of what AI is, and what it is not, including a discussion of the notions of Strong and Weak AI. Strong AI hypothesizes that the human mind is nothing more than a computational device and thus that computers can in principle be programmed with the capability of thought (i.e., to truly reason and solve problems). Contrast this with Weak AI which does not focus on whether machines can be made to actually think, but rather whether machines can be made to act intelligently. We will read and discuss articles by the pioneering scientists and philosophers that explore these notions. Next, the course will focus on introducing the student to applications of AI that have been making their ways into our everyday lives. Attention will be placed on the ethical issues and the impacts AI technology will continue to make on society. The course will include a combination of lectures, class discussion of films (both fiction and non-fiction) and assigned readings (both non-fiction and fiction), as well as current day news articles. Counts as an elective for the Minor in Behavioral Neuroscience. Fulfills university's Historically Conscious (H) requirement, and offered as a Writing Across the Curriculum (W2) course.
