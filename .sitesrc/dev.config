<h2><a href="https://dev.to/cicirello"><img alt="DEV Profile" src="/images/devto.svg" width="32" height="32"></a> Blog</h2>
<p>My intention is to create a more general blog here on my personal website covering whatever topics I feel like
blogging about. For now, I have been writing blog posts on <a href="https://dev.to">DEV</a>, a community-focused platform for
software development. Check out <a href="https://dev.to/cicirello">my profile on DEV</a> for a full list of my posts.
My posts on DEV cover various open source tools that I've authored and maintain, including functionality, and example
usage. This includes posts about GitHub Actions I've implemented. GitHub Actions is GitHub's CI/CD framework. Other posts
concern my research software libraries (well, I plan to write such posts). In other cases, I've posted tips and tricks 
related to using various open source tools, etc.</p>

<h3>Selection of Posts in Chronological Order</h3>
<p>Here is a selection of my posts on DEV in reverse chronological order, along with very brief summaries of the post contents and topic.</p>
<ul>

<li><p><a href="https://dev.to/cicirello/how-programming-and-classic-television-are-alike-4e7a">How Programming and Classic Television are Alike</a>, posted on DEV on September 7, 2022.</p>
<p>What does programming have to do with Mr T, Cheers, the Golden Girls, the Brady Bunch, Full House, Quantum Leap, Gilligan's Island, Oscar the Grouch, Family Matters, Home Improvement, and Night Court? Probably nothing. But none-the-less this post connects programming to classic American television shows, personalities, and characters.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://dev.to/cicirello/configuring-githubs-linguist-to-improve-repository-language-reporting-295b">Configuring GitHub's Linguist to Improve Repository Language Reporting</a>, posted on DEV on August 31, 2022.</p>
<p>This blog post is a <em>how to</em> for configuring GitHub's <a href="https://github.com/github/linguist">Linguist</a> in a GitHub repository, such as for the purpose of correcting errors in the detected languages, or directing Linguist to report languages that are excluded by default, within the context of tools such as the <a href="https://actions.cicirello.org/user-statistician/">user-statistician</a> GitHub Action that I developed and maintain, which generates a chart summarizing the language usage in all of your public repositories, as well as for the language charts built into every GitHub repository.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://dev.to/cicirello/on-jitpacks-use-of-git-repository-name-as-maven-artifactid-deb">On JitPack's use of git repository name as Maven <code>artifactId</code></a>, posted on DEV on August 18, 2022.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I continue my series of tips and tricks on JitPack usage, explaining a limitation of JitPack related to JitPack defining the <code>artifactId</code> of a library to be its git repository name. I use one of my libraries, <a href="https://jpt.cicirello.org/">JavaPermutationTools</a>, as an example of this limitation. And offer a tip that may help overcome the limitation in some cases.</p>

<p>In this blog post, I discuss how and why to publish Java library artifacts via <a href="https://jitpack.io/">JitPack</a>, even if you already release libraries via <a href="https://search.maven.org/">Maven Central</a>. I provide detailed examples utilizing one of my libraries, <a href="https://chips-n-salsa.cicirello.org/">Chips-n-Salsa</a>, of how to use JitPack to import SNAPSHOTs of dependencies via commit hash, tag, and pull-request number. Additionally, I provide detailed examples of how to configure JitPack to build with more recent versions of the Java JDK, such as 17.</p>
