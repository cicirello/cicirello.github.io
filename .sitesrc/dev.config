<p>My intention is to create a more general blog here on my personal website covering whatever topics I feel like
blogging about. For now, I have been writing blog posts on <a href="https://dev.to">DEV</a>, a community-focused platform for
software development. Check out <a href="https://dev.to/cicirello">my profile on DEV</a> for a full list of my posts.
My posts on DEV cover various open source tools that I've authored and maintain, including functionality, and example
usage. This includes posts about GitHub Actions I've implemented. GitHub Actions is GitHub's CI/CD framework. Other posts
concern my research software libraries (well, I plan to write such posts). In other cases, I've posted tips and tricks 
related to using various open source tools, etc.</p>

<h3>Selection of Posts in Chronological Order</h3>
<p>Here is a selection of my posts on DEV in reverse chronological order.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://dev.to/cicirello/the-jacoco-badge-generator-github-action-is-now-also-available-as-a-cli-tool-from-pypi-3ma0">The jacoco-badge-generator GitHub Action is now also available as a CLI tool from PyPI</a>, posted on DEV on July 8, 2022.</p>
<p>This post introduces an update to the <a href="https://actions.cicirello.org/jacoco-badge-generator/">jacoco-badge-generator</a> that includes the ability to use as a command line tool,
rather than strictly as a GitHub Action. Several examples of how to use the new functionality is covered, including how
to install from PyPI.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://dev.to/cicirello/jacoco-coverage-badges-pr-coverage-checks-and-pr-coverage-comments-from-github-actions-4a8f">JaCoCo coverage badges, PR coverage checks, and PR coverage comments, from GitHub Actions</a>, posted on DEV on November 29, 2021.</p>
<p>This post introduces an update to the <a href="https://actions.cicirello.org/jacoco-badge-generator/">jacoco-badge-generator</a>, which includes pull-request coverage checks.
Additionally, it provides an example workflow demonstrating how to use it in combination with the GitHub CLI
to automate commenting on pull requests with the test coverage. This workflow was a submission to the DEV/GitHub Actions
Hackathon.</p>

<p>This post serves a dual purpose: (a) providing a midway progress report on Hacktoberfest 2021, and (b) providing insights
learned related to the internationalization effort for the <a href="https://actions.cicirello.org/user-statistician/">user-statistician</a> GitHub Action.</p>

<p>I decided to participate in Hacktoberfest as a project maintainer for October 2021. I used Hacktoberfest as an opportunity to Internationalize the <a href="https://actions.cicirello.org/user-statistician/">user-statistician</a> GitHub Action, with Hacktoberfest contributors providing translations to various languages.</p>

<p>This post introduced a GitHub Action that I implemented, called the <a href="https://actions.cicirello.org/user-statistician/">user-statistician</a>, which is designed to 
query the GitHub GraphQL API and generate an SVG image summarizing your activity on GitHub.</p>
