best represented by permutations. The classic traveling salesperson seeks an optimal 
ordering over a set of cities. Scheduling problems often seek optimal orderings of 
tasks or activities. Although some evolutionary approaches to such problems utilize 
the bit strings of a genetic algorithm, it is more common to directly represent 
solutions with permutations. Evolving permutations directly requires specialized 
evolutionary operators. Over the years, many crossover and mutation operators have 
been developed for solving permutation problems with evolutionary algorithms. In this 
paper, we survey the breadth of evolutionary operators for permutations. We implemented 
all of these in Chips-n-Salsa, an open source Java library for evolutionary 
computation. Finally, we empirically analyze the crossover operators on artificial 
fitness landscapes isolating different permutation features.}

in many modeling and simulation applications, such as in medicine, risk 
management, and fraud and anomaly detection, among others. A variety of algorithms 
exist for generating binomial random variates. This paper concerns the 
algorithm chosen for &rho;&mu;, an open source Java library for efficient 
randomization, which uses a hybrid of two existing binomial random variate 
algorithms: the BTPE Algorithm (Binomial, Triangle, Parallelogram, Exponential)
and the inverse transform for cases that BTPE cannot handle. BTPE uses 
rejection sampling, and BTPE's authors originally provided an analytical 
formula for the expected number of iterations in terms of n and p. That 
expression is complicated to interpret in practical contexts. I explore BTPE 
by instrumenting &rho;&mu;'s implementation to empirically analyze its 
acceptance/rejection behavior to gain further insights into its runtime 
performance. Although the number of iterations depends upon n and p, my 
experiments show that the average number of iterations is always under two, 
and that the average number of random uniform variates required to generate a 
single random binomial is under four (two per iteration). Thus, when analyzing 
the runtime of a simulation algorithm that includes steps generating random 
binomials, one can consider such steps to have a constant runtime.}

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we explore the theory and expand upon the practice of fitness
landscape analysis for optimization problems over the space of permutations. Many of the 
computational and analytical tools for fitness landscape analysis, such as fitness distance
correlation, require identifying a distance metric for measuring the similarity of different 
solutions to the problem. We begin with a survey of the available distance metrics for 
permutations, and then use principal component analysis to classify these metrics. The result 
of this analysis aligns with existing classifications of permutation problem types produced 
through less formal means, including the A-permutation, R-permutation, and P-permutation types, 
which classifies problems by whether absolute position of permutation elements, relative positions 
of elements, or general precedence of pairs of elements, is the dominant influence 
over solution fitness. Additionally, the formal analysis identifies subtypes within these problem 
categories. We see that the classification can assist in identifying appropriate metrics based on 
optimization problem feature for use in fitness landscape analysis. Using optimization problems 
of each class, we also demonstrate how the classification scheme can subsequently inform the 
choice of mutation operator within an evolutionary algorithm. From this, we present a classification
of a variety of mutation operators as a counterpart to that of the metrics. Our implementations 
of the permutation metrics, permutation mutation operators, and associated evolutionary algorithm, are 
available in a pair of open source Java libraries. All of the code necessary to recreate our 
analysis and experimental results are also available as open source.}

ABSTRACT = {Our society is facing a new era of automation, not only in industry but also 
in our daily lives. Computers are everywhere, and their employment is no longer relegated 
to just industry or work but also to entertainment and leisure. Computing and artificial 
intelligence are not simply scientific lab experiments for publishing papers in major 
journals and conferences but opportunities to make our lives better.  
</p><p>
Among the different fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning is certainly 
one of the most studied in recent years. There has been a gigantic shift in the last 
few decades due to the birth of deep learning, which has opened unprecedented theoretic 
and application-based opportunities.
</p><p>
In this context, advances in machine and deep learning are discovered on a daily 
basis, but still much has to be learned. For instance, the functioning of deep learning 
architectures is still partially obscure and explaining it will foster new applications, 
algorithms and architectures. While deep learning is considered the hottest topic of 
artificial intelligence nowadays, still much interest is raised by traditional machine 
learning, especially in (but not limited to) new learning paradigms, extendibility to 
big/huge data applications, and optimization.
</p><p>
Even more diffused, then, are the (new) applications of machine and deep learning, 
to finance, healthcare, sustainability, climate science, neuroscience, to name a few. 
Continuing and improving the research in machine and deep learning will not only be a 
chance for new surprising discoveries, but also a way to contribute to our wellbeing 
and economical growth.

ABSTRACT = {Evolutionary algorithms solve problems by simulating the evolution of a 
population of candidate solutions. We focus on evolving permutations
for ordering problems such as the traveling salesperson problem (TSP), as well as 
assignment problems such as the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) and largest 
common subgraph (LCS). We propose cycle mutation, a new mutation operator
whose inspiration is the well-known cycle crossover operator, and the concept 
of a permutation cycle. We use fitness landscape analysis to explore the 
problem characteristics for which cycle mutation works best. As a 
prerequisite, we develop new permutation distance measures: cycle distance, 
k-cycle distance, and cycle edit distance. The fitness landscape analysis 
predicts that cycle mutation is better suited for assignment and mapping problems 
than it is for ordering problems. We experimentally validate these findings 
showing cycle mutation's strengths on problems such as QAP and LCS, and its 
limitations on problems such as the TSP, while also showing that it is less prone 
to local optima than commonly used alternatives. We integrate cycle mutation 
into the open source Chips-n-Salsa library, and the new distance metrics into 
the open source JavaPermutationTools library.}

ABSTRACT = {The runtime behavior of Simulated Annealing (SA), similar to other 
metaheuristics, is controlled by hyperparameters. For SA, hyperparameters 
affect how temperature varies over time, and temperature in turn 
affects SA's decisions on whether or not to transition to neighboring states.
It is typically necessary to tune the hyperparameters ahead of time.
However, there are adaptive annealing schedules that use search feedback to
evolve the temperature during the search. A classic and generally 
effective adaptive annealing schedule is the Modified Lam. Although effective, 
the Modified Lam can be sensitive to the scale of the cost function, and is 
sometimes slow to converge to its target behavior. In this paper, we present a 
novel variation of the Modified Lam that we call Self-Tuning Lam, which uses 
early search feedback to auto-adjust its self-adaptive behavior. Using a 
variety of discrete and continuous optimization problems, we demonstrate the 
ability of the Self-Tuning Lam to nearly instantaneously converge to its target 
behavior independent of the scale of the cost function, as well as its run 
length. Our implementation is integrated into Chips-n-Salsa, an open-source 
Java library for parallel and self-adaptive local search.}

importance as well as computationally intractable. For example, the traveling 
salesperson, bin packing, and longest common subsequence problems are NP-Hard, 
as is resource constrained scheduling, and many single-machine scheduling problems. 
Polynomial time algorithms for such problems are unlikely to exist, and the best 
known algorithms that guarantee optimal solutions have a worst-case exponential 
runtime. It is thus common to use stochastic local search and other metaheuristics. 
Stochastic local search algorithms begin at a random search state, and apply a 
sequence of neighbor transitions to nearby search states. This includes 
perturbative algorithms like simulated annealing and hill climbers, where 
each search state is a complete candidate feasible solution, and a mutation 
operator makes a small random modification to move to another local candidate 
solution; and also includes constructive algorithms like stochastic samplers, 
where each search state is a partial solution that is iteratively transformed into 
a complete solution. Stochastic local search algorithms do not guarantee 
optimal solutions. However, they often find near-optimal solutions in much 
less time than systematic search. They also offer an anytime property, where 
solution quality improves with runtime.</p>
<p>Chips-n-Salsa is a Java library of customizable, hybridizable, iterative, 
parallel, stochastic, and self-adaptive local search algorithms. Its focus is 
discrete optimization, but also supports continuous optimization. The library 
provides a variety of solution representations, including BitVector and IntegerVector 
classes, indexable vectors of bits and integers, respectively, along with 
corresponding mutation operators. The library utilizes our significant prior 
research on permutation optimization problems, providing an extensive set 
of mutation operators for permutations, including window-limited mutation. 
It uses the JavaPermutationTools (JPT) library for efficiently representing 
solutions to such problems. For continuous problems, Chips-n-Salsa provides a 
RealVector class, Gaussian mutation, Cauchy mutation, and uniform mutation. The 
library includes optimization problems useful for benchmarking metaheuristic 
implementations, such as the well-known OneMax problem, BoundMax (generalization 
of OneMax to integers), the Permutation in a Haystack problem, and polynomial root 
finding.</p>

fitness landscape analysis of optimization problems require identifying 
a distance metric that characterizes the similarity of different solutions 
to the problem.  For example, fitness distance correlation is Pearson 
correlation between solution fitness and distance to the nearest 
optimal solution.  In this paper, we survey the available distance 
metrics for permutations, and use principal component analysis to 
classify the metrics.  The result is aligned with existing classifications 
of permutation problem types produced through less formal means, 
including the A-permutation, R-permutation, and P-permutation types, 
and has also identified subtypes.  The classification can assist in 
identifying appropriate metrics based on optimization problem feature 
for use in fitness landscape analysis.  Implementations of all of the 
permutation metrics, and the code for our analysis, are available as open source.}

abstract = {Permutations can represent a wide variety of ordered data.  For example,
a permutation may represent an individual's preferences (or ranking) of a collection
of products such as books or music.  Or perhaps a permutation may represent a route
for delivering a set of packages.  Permutations can also represent one-to-one mappings 
between sets (e.g., instructors to courses at a fixed time).  There are applications 
where measuring the distance between a pair of permutations is necessary.  For example,
a recommender system may assess the similarity of two individuals' preferences 
for music to make song recommendations.  Depending upon the application, 
the permutation features most important to distance calculation may be 
the absolute positions of the elements (e.g., one-to-one mappings), the adjacency 
of elements (e.g., the routing example), or general precedence of pairs of 
elements (e.g., music preferences).  Thus, it is no surprise that there
are many permutation metrics in the research literature.</p>
<p>The motivation and origin of this library is our research on fitness landscape analysis 
for permutation optimization.  In a 
permutation optimization problem, solutions are represented by 
permutations of some set, and the objective is to maximize 
or minimize some function.  For example, a solution 
to a traveling salesperson problem is the permutation of the set of cities
that corresponds to the minimal cost tour.
During our research, we developed a Java library of permutation distance 
metrics.  Most of the distance metrics in the literature are described mathematically with 
no source code available.  Thus, our library offers convenient access to efficient 
implementations of a variety of metrics with a common programmatic 
interface.  The library also provides metrics on sequences (strings and arrays of 
various types); where unlike a permutation, a sequence may contain multiple copies of the same element.</p>
<p>The source repository 
(https://github.com/cicirello/JavaPermutationTools) 
contains source code of the library, programs that provide example 
usage of key functionality, as well as programs that reproduce results from papers that 
have used the library.  API documentation is hosted on the web 
(https://jpt.cicirello.org/).}

The foundation of our approach is the Modified Lam annealing schedule, which adaptively controls the temperature parameter 
to track a theoretically ideal rate of acceptance of neighboring states.  A sequential implementation of Modified Lam simulated 
annealing is almost parameter-free.  However, it requires prior knowledge of the annealing length.  We eliminate this  
parameter using restarts, with an exponentially increasing schedule of annealing lengths.  We then extend this restart schedule to
parallel implementation, executing several Modified Lam simulated annealers in 
parallel, with varying initial annealing lengths, and our proposed parallel annealing length schedule.
To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on an 
NP-Hard scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup constraints.  We compare our approach to fixed 
length restarts, both sequentially and in parallel.  
Our results show that our approach can achieve substantial performance gains, throughout the course of the run, 
demonstrating our approach to be an effective anytime algorithm.}

science students, students typically learn the fundamental software processes
spanning the software development lifecycle ‚Äì from requirements specification
through architectural design, implementation, testing, and evolution, along
with the software tools that support the development activities. Courses in
software engineering often incorporate semester long team projects, where
students collaborate on a software development project. Thus, in addition to
developing the technical skills associated with software development, the
software engineering course is a common place where computer science
students develop their skills in teamwork and collaboration, as well as in
communications. The nature and type of projects in such courses varies.
Some integrate projects where students develop software for "real clients"
such as on campus departments, or local non-profits, while others have been
increasing exposure to open source development with students contributing to
existing open source projects. In our software engineering course, we have
recently introduced course projects where teams of students specify, design,
and implement software that assists computer science students in learning
fundamental computer science topics. In this paper, we present our experience
with such CS learning tool projects, including a discussion of the impact on
student outcomes in a senior-level course on software engineering. We
compare this experience to our prior use of "real projects for real clients" in
this same course. We find that students who participate in the CS learning tool
projects perceive an increase in learning progress on fundamental principles,
theories, and factual knowledge, as compared to their peers in course sections
with "real projects for real clients," with an equivalent effect on teamwork and
collaboration skills. Most surprisingly, the students who develop CS learning
tools report a significantly higher level of progress on industrial relevant skill
development as compared to the students who develop so called "real projects
for real clients."}

of search landscapes through examination of local fitness rates of change. We use our approach to analyze 
the behavior of common permutation mutation operators on a variety of permutation in a haystack landscapes;

They are especially useful in dynamic situations where problem solving may be temporally constrained. 
However, dispatch heuristics have also been effectively used for guidance within more intensive 
search algorithms, expanding their applicability well beyond simple myopic job or task selection. 
In this paper, we present a new crossover operator for genetic algorithms (GA) where a permutation 
representation is employed. Our new operator directly integrates problem-dependent knowledge in the 
form of a dispatch scheduling policy into the crossover step of a GA which is usually a problem-independent 
recombination. Our novel crossover operator, Heuristic Sequencing Crossover (HeurX), recombines elements of 
M parents into a single child and is specifically designed for steady-state GAs. We empirically demonstrate 
its effectiveness on a strongly NP-Hard scheduling problem known as Weighted Tardiness Scheduling with 
Sequence-Dependent Setups. We compare our approach to a generational GA using a problem-independent crossover 
operator. We show the potential power of integrating problem-dependent knowledge via a dispatch heuristic into 
what is traditionally a problem independent problem solver.}

abstract = {In this paper, we explore the potential important role that unannounced 
(or "pop") quizzes can play in CS-1. "Pop" quizzes generate continual feedback to both 
the student and the instructor of the course. They also encourage students to avoid missing 
class unless necessary. We present the results of a three year study on the effectiveness of "pop" 
quizzes in CS-1. Our results demonstrate that students who experience "pop" quizzes in CS-1 score 
higher on exams than do their counterparts who did not experience "pop" quizzes. This appears especially 
true for upperclassmen, particularly for juniors. The use of "pop" quizzes in CS-1 also improves performance 
on programming assignments for juniors. CS/IS majors and Math majors both receive a greater benefit 
from "pop" quizzes than do other non-majors.}

Active learning helps to keep students engaged in the learning process and is useful at all levels 
of computer science education from introductory courses on programming through more advanced upper 
level topics and graduate level coursework. In this paper, we present an active learning exercise 
that we developed for use in courses on artificial intelligence for demonstrating heuristic search 
concepts as well as concepts related to swarm intelligence. We have also found the exercise useful 
in an interdisciplinary course for non-majors to demonstrate some of the problem solving approaches 
of computer science. It is also applicable to courses on discrete mathematics. The exercise that we 
call Collective Bin Packing is an adaptation of the well-known combinatorial optimization problem 
known as bin packing. During the exercise, students take turns deciding upon individual problem 
solving steps. A follow-up class discussion draws out the algorithmic elements of the students' 
collective reasoning process. An interactive Java application is used to facilitate the group problem solving exercise.}

During three academic years, we studied what students in CS-1 choose when given the option to 
either pair program or to program independently. We explore which students choose to pair and 
how often, and examine the majors and academic years of the self-selected pairs. Among our objectives 
is to learn about student pair preferences to help guide the assignment of partners when mandatory pair 
programming is used. We show that Math majors are more likely than Computer Science/Information Systems

an interdisciplinary perspective. The course largely focuses on the diverse applications to many fields of endeavor, and the

diverse fields including computer science, philosophy, psychology, game theory, among others. One of the goals of the course is 
to engage students from disciplines outside the computing sciences, while drawing on the strengths of their individual backgrounds. 
A secondary objective is to raise awareness among students outside of the computing sciences that there is more to computer

the utility of integrating the network and agent layers and enabling agents to reason about the current operating context.

and exploitation in search problems. The classic problem involves allocating trials to the arms of a multiarmed 
slot machine to maximize the expected sum of rewards. We pose a new variation of the multiarmed bandit, the Max K-Armed Bandit, 
in which trials must be allocated among the arms to maximize the expected best single sample reward of the series of trials. 
Motivation for the Max K-Armed Bandit is the allocation of restarts among a set of multistart stochastic search algorithms. 
We present an analysis of this Max K-Armed Bandit showing under certain assumptions that the optimal strategy allocates trials 
to the observed best arm at a rate increasing double exponentially relative to the other arms. This motivates an exploration 
strategy that follows a Boltzmann distribution with an exponentially decaying temperature parameter. We compare this exploration 
policy to policies that allocate trials to the observed best arm at rates faster (and slower) than double exponentially. 
The results confirm, for two scheduling domains, that the double exponential increase in the rate of allocations to the 
observed best heuristic outperforms the other approaches.}

All of the usual difficulties associated with a distributed system are present, but are amplified by the inherent dynamics and uncertainty of

systems for a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) of resource-constrained devices. Specifically, the authors codify within the context of a software 
design pattern the concept of an agent swarm. Swarms of mobile agents have been used in the development of applications to support coordination 
and collaboration in a live MANET test bed. Work is underway to transition some of this technology into use by public protectors as part of the 
Philadelphia area urban wireless network testbed. The objectives of this paper include motivating the need for a swarm-based approach to 
distributed software for wireless environments and discussing the critical issues involved with mobile agents swarming on a MANET. For example, 
one such design issue is the selection of migration patterns for use by the swarming agents. Several different types of itinerary patterns are 
evaluated within the context of a mobile agent swarm.}

abstract = {The success of stochastic algorithms is often due to their ability to effectively amplify the performance of search heuristics. 
This is certainly the case with stochastic sampling algorithms such as heuristic-biased stochastic sampling (HBSS) and value-biased stochastic sampling (VBSS), 
wherein a heuristic is used to bias a stochastic policy for choosing among alternative branches in the search tree. One complication in getting the most 
out of algorithms like HBSS and VBSS in a given problem domain is the need to identify the most effective search heuristic. 
In many domains, the relative performance of various heuristics tends to vary across different problem instances and no single heuristic dominates. 
In such cases, the choice of any given heuristic will be limiting and it would be advantageous to gain the collective power of several heuristics. 
Toward this goal, this paper describes a framework for integrating multiple heuristics within a stochastic sampling search algorithm. In its essence, 
the framework uses online-generated statistical models of the search performance of different base heuristics to select which to employ on each 
subsequent iteration of the search. To estimate the solution quality distribution resulting from repeated application of a strong heuristic within 
a stochastic search, we propose the use of models from extreme value theory (EVT). Our EVT-motivated approach is validated on the NP-Hard problem 
of resource-constrained project scheduling with time windows (RCPSP/max). Using VBSS as a base stochastic sampling algorithm, the integrated use 
of a set of project scheduling heuristics is shown to be competitive with the current best known heuristic algorithm for RCPSP/max and in some cases 
even improves upon best known solutions to difficult benchmark instances.}

stochastic sampling (VBSS), which emphasizes the use of heuristic value in determining stochastic bias. We 
offer an empirical study of the performance of value-biased and rank-biased approaches to randomizing search heuristics.

lightweight, easily transportable computing devices-in which each node can act as a router for network traffic rather than relying 
on fixed networking infrastructure. As mobile computing becomes ubiquitous, MANETS becomes increasingly important. As a 
design paradigm, multiagent systems (MASs) can help facilitate and coordinate ad hoc-scenarios that might include security personnel, 
rescue workers, police officers, firefighters, and paramedics. On this network, mobile agents perform critical functions that include 
delivering messages, monitoring resource usage on constrained mobile devices, assessing network traffic patterns, analyzing host behaviors, 
and revoking access rights for suspicious hosts and agents. Agents can effectively operate in such environments if they are environment 
aware - if they can sense and reason about their complex and dynamic environments. Altogether, agents living on a MANET must be network, 
information, and performance aware. This article fleshes out how we apply this approach to populations of mobile agents on a live MANET.}

Such approaches are attractive because they offer increased robustness against the unpredictability of factory operations. 
But the specification of local coordination policies that give rise to efficient global performance and effectively adapt to 
changing circumstances remains an interesting challenge. In this paper, we present a new approach to this coordination problem, 
drawing on various aspects of a computational model of how wasp colonies coordinate individual activities and allocate tasks 
to meet the collective needs of the nest.</p>
<p>We focus specifically on the problem of configuring parallel multi-purpose machines in a factory to best satisfy product demands over time. 
Wasp-like computational agents that we call routing wasps act as overall machine proxies. These agents use a model of wasp task allocation 
behavior, coupled with a model of wasp dominance hierarchy formation, to determine which new jobs should be accepted into the machine's queue. 
If you view our system from a market-oriented perspective, the policies that the routing wasps independently adapt for their respective machines 
can be likened to policies for deciding when to bid and when not to bid for arriving jobs.</p>
<p>We benchmark the performance of our system on the real-world problem of assigning trucks to paint booths in a simulated vehicle paintshop. 
The objective of this problem is to minimize the number of paint color changes accrued by the system, assuming no a priori knowledge of the 
color sequence or color distribution of trucks arriving in the system. We demonstrate that our system outperforms the bidding mechanism 
originally implemented for the problem as well as another related adaptive bidding mechanism.}

of issues such as key maintenance, forming and communicating in secure groups, or interlayer security. From a security 
engineering perspective, multi-agent systems introduce new channels and possibly layers, resulting in additional security concerns. 
A comprehensive security engineering perspective - studying the information flow of the multi-layered system, identifying, 
analyzing and addressing multi-level security threats - is rarely taken. This paper presents a security engineering process for 
multi-agent systems - motivating the need for comprehensive security engineering and showing how to proceed with the process within 
an agent system. One of the largest obstacles in security engineering is understanding how to decompose a system into the parts 
that require security. This paper provides a decomposition for agent systems that can be directly applied to the security engineering process. 
Examples are given that detail the application of the presented security engineering process to: 1) a FIPA-compliant agent system; 
and 2) peer-to-peer content lookup. The most important contribution of this paper, is proposing a formal approach to addressing security 
within an agent system, where there exist unique and application-specific threats that must be addressed.}

we propose an ecology-inspired approach to the management of the number of agents. The approach associates 
agents with living organisms and tasks with food. Agents procreate or die based on the abundance of 
uncompleted tasks (food). We performed a series of experiments investigating properties of such systems and 
analyzed their stability under various conditions. We concluded that the ecology based metaphor can be 
successfully applied to the management of agent populations on wireless ad hoc networks.}

<p>SWAT Security is monitored by agents that manage keys, assess network traffic 
patterns and analyze host behaviors.  Agents can use machine learning to 
develop profiles for nominal agent, hardware platform and network states.  
Given learned profiles, detection agents identify specific problems in SWAT, 
including over-runs/capture, and malicious insiders.  Other agents monitor the 
health of the network and the devices in the network, looking for network 
attacks and security breaches.  Using this framework, agents can revoke access 
rights for suspicious hosts or agents and adaptively re-route traffic at the 
network layer to improve the information integrity of the overall system.  
Agents also provide the implementation framework for decentralized user 
applications, including those for authentication, collaboration, messaging, and

abstract = {In many combinatorial domains, simple stochastic algorithms often exhibit superior
performance when compared to highly customized approaches. Many of these simple algorithms
outperform more sophisticated approaches on difficult benchmark problems; and
often lead to better solutions as the algorithms are taken out of the world of benchmarks
and into the real-world. Simple stochastic algorithms are often robust, scalable problem
solvers.</p>
<p>This thesis explores methods for combining sets of heuristics within a single stochastic
search. The ability of stochastic search to amplify heuristics is often a key factor in its
success. Heuristics are not, however, infallible and in most domains no single heuristic
dominates. It is therefore desirable to gain the collective power of a set of heuristics; and to
design a search control framework capable of producing a hybrid algorithm from component
heuristics with the ability to customize itself to a given problem instance. A primary
goal is to explore what can be learned from quality distributions of iterative stochastic
search in combinatorial optimization domains; and to exploit models of quality distributions
to enhance the performance of stochastic problem solvers. We hypothesize that models
of solution quality can lead to effective search control mechanisms, providing a general
framework for combining multiple heuristics into an enhanced decision-making process.
These goals lead to the development of a search control framework, called QD-BEACON,
that uses online-generated statistical models of search performance to effectively combine
search heuristics. A prerequisite goal is to develop a suitable stochastic sampling algorithm
for combinatorial search problems. This goal leads to the development of an algorithm
called VBSS that makes better use, in general, of the discriminatory power of a given
search heuristic as compared to existing sampling approaches.</p>
<p>The search frameworks of this thesis are evaluated on combinatorial optimization problems.
Specifically, we show that: 1) VBSS is an effective method for amplifying heuristic
performance for the weighted tardiness sequencing problem with sequence-dependent setups;
2) QD-BEACON can enhance the current best known algorithm for weighted tardiness
sequencing; and 3) QD-BEACON and VBSS together provide the new best heuristic
algorithm for the constrained optimization problem known as RCPSP/max.}

environments, because they describe the shape and form of manufactured artifacts. 
Their growing ubiquity has created new problems in how to effectively manage the many 
models that are now stored in the digital libraries for large design and manufacturing 
enterprises. Existing techniques from the engineering literature and industrial practice, 
such as group technology, rely on human-supervised encodings and classification; techniques 
from the multimedia database and computer graphics/vision communities often ignore the 
manufacturing attributes that are most significant in the classification of models. This 
paper presents our approach to comparing the manufacturing similarity assessments of solid 
models of mechanical parts based on machining features. Our technical approach is threefold: 
perform machining feature extraction, construct a model dependency graph (MDG) from the set 
of machining features, and partition the models in a database using a measure of similarity 
based on the MDGs. We introduce two heuristic search techniques for comparing MDGs and present 
empirical experiments to validate our approach using our testbed, the National Design Repository.}

domains has received increasing interest in recent years. In optimization contexts, it can 
provide a means for overcoming the deficiencies of available search heuristics and broadening 
search in productive directions. In this paper, we consider the issue of amplifying the performance 
of a search heuristic through randomization. We introduce a general framework for embedding a base 
heuristic within an iterative sampling process and searching a stochastic neighborhood of the 
heuristic's prescribed trajectory. In contrast to previous approaches, which have used rank-ordering 
as a basis for randomization, our approach instead relies on assigned heuristic value. Use of heuristic 
value is important because it makes it possible to vary the level of stochasticity in relation to the 
discriminatory power of the heuristic in different decision contexts, and hence concentrate search 
around those decisions where the heuristic is least informative. To evaluate the efficacy of the 
approach, we apply it to a complex, weighted-tardiness scheduling problem. Taking a state-of-the-art 
heuristic for this scheduling problem as a starting point, we demonstrate an ability to consistently 
and significantly improve on the deterministic heuristic solution across a broad range of problem 
instances. Our approach is also shown to consistently outperform a previously developed, rank-ordering 
based approach to randomizing the same heuristic in terms of percentage of improvement obtained.}

the dispatch policy to bias a stochastic selection process. WHISTLING provides a fast and effective method for sampling from

the set of jobs queued in front of any given machine as a wasp nest, wherein wasp-like agents interact 
to form a social hierarchy and prioritize the jobs that they represent. Other wasp-like agents external 
to the nest act as overall machine proxies, and use a model of wasp task allocation behavior to determine 
which new jobs should be accepted into the machine's queue. We show for simple factories that our multi-agent 
system achieves the desired effect. For a given job mix, the system converges to a factory configuration 
that maximizes overall performance, and as the job mix changes, the system quickly adapts to a new, 
more appropriate configuration.}

abstract = {The factory is a complex dynamic environment and scheduling
operations for such an environment is a challenging problem.
In practice, dispatch scheduling policies are commonly
employed, as they offer an efficient and robust solution. However,
dispatch scheduling policies are generally myopic, and
as such they are susceptible to sub-optimal decision-making.
In this paper, we attempt to improve upon results of such
dispatch policies by introducing non-determinism into the
decision-making process, and instead using a given policy
as a baseline for biasing stochastic decisions. We consider
the problem of weighted tardiness scheduling with sequence-dependent
setups with unknown arrival times in a dynamic
environment, and show that randomization of state-of-the-art
dispatch heuristics for this problem in this manner can improve
performance. Furthermore, we find that the "easier"
the problem, the less benefit there is from randomization; the
"harder" the problem, the more benefit. Our method of randomization
is based on a model of the way colonies of wasps
self-organize social hierarchies in nature.}

Our system, which we call Ant Colony Control (AC2), applies the analogy of a colony of ants 
foraging for food to the problem of dynamic shop floor routing. In this system, 
artificial ants use only indirect communication to make all shop routing decisions by 
altering and reacting to their dynamically changing common environment through the use of 
simulated pheromone trails. For simple factory layouts, we show that the emergent behavior 
of the colony is comparable to using the optimal routing strategy. Furthermore, as the complexity 
of the factory layout is increased, we show that the adaptive behavior of AC2 evolves local 
decision making policies that lead to near-optimal solutions from the standpoint of global performance.}

<p>This paper presents our approach 
to the manufacturing similarly assessment of solid models of mechanical parts based on machining 
features. Our technical approach is three-fold: (1) perform machining feature extraction to map the 
solid model to a set of STEP AP 224 machining features; (2) construct a model dependency graph 
from the set of machining features; and (3) find the nearest neighbors to the query graph using an 
iterative improvement search across a database of other models. We also present empirical experiments 
to validate our approach using our testbed, the National Design Repository.</p>
<p>The contribution of this

Some of the systems in this study tend to converge upon deficient NE; while the others
successfully coordinate upon "better" equilibria on a consistent basis.}

abstract = {Graph matching problems of varying types are important in a wide array of application areas.  A graph matching problem is a problem
involving some form of comparison between graphs.  Some of the many application areas of such problems include information
retrieval, sub-circuit identification, chemical structure classification, and networks.  Problems of efficient graph matching
arise in any field that may be modeled with graphs.  For example, any problem that can be modeled with binary relations between entities in the
domain is such a problem.  The individual entities in the problem domain become nodes in the graph.  And each binary relation becomes
an edge between the appropriate nodes.  Although it is possible to formulate such a large array of problems as graph matching problems, it is not 
necessarily a good idea to do so.</p>
<p>Graph matching is a very difficult problem.  The graph isomorphism problem is to determine if there exists a one-to-one mapping from the nodes
of one graph to the nodes of a second graph that preserves adjacency.  Similarly, the subgraph isomorphism problem is to determine if there
exists a one-to-one mapping from the nodes of a given graph to the nodes of a subgraph of a second graph that preserves adjacency.  The 
largest common subgraph problem is to find the largest subgraphs of two given graphs such that the subgraphs are isomorphic.  The
digraph D-morphism problem is to determine if there exists a one-to-one mapping from the nodes of one directed graph to the nodes of a second 
directed graph that preserves adjacency if you disregard the directions of the arcs.
The closely related problems of subgraph isomorphism, largest common subgraph, and digraph D-morphism are known to be 
NP-complete.  Whether or not the graph isomorphism problem is in the
class of NP-complete problems is an open question.  Although there do exist special cases of each of these
problems that can be solved in polynomial time, there do not exist known algorithms of polynomial complexity to solve these
problems in the general case.  Therefore, the search for more
efficient solutions to these problems is of great importance.}

abstract = {This presentation describes our initial effort to deploy a digital library to support engineering design and
manufacturing. This experimental testbed, The Engineering Design Repository, is an effort to collect and
archive public domain engineering data for use by researchers and engineering professionals.</p>
<p>CAD knowledge-bases are vital to engineers, who search through vast amounts of corporate legacy data
and navigate on-line catalogs to retrieve precisely the right components for assembly into new products. For
example, it is conservatively estimated that more than 75% of design activity involves the reuse of previous
designs.</p>
<p>Our research begins to address the critical need for improved computational methods for reasoning about
complex geometric, feature, and engineering information. In particular, we focus on archival and reuse of
design and manufacturing data for mechatronic systems. We describe the research problems, give an overview
of the initial architecture of testbed, and introduce some of our current results. We expect this work to help
to further the mathematical foundation and algorithmic tools to support content-based retrieval from large
engineering knowledge-bases.}
