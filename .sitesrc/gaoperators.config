TITLE
Genetic Operators for Permutation Representation - Research - Vincent A. Cicirello - Professor of Computer Science

DESCRIPTION 
The permutation representation for genetic algorithms requires specialized operators. A wide variety of crossover and mutation
operators for permutations exist in the research literature. In my research on evolutionary computation for optimizing permutation structures,
I have developed several crossover and mutation operators, including Cycle Mutation, 
Non-Wrapping Order Crossover (NWOX), Uniform Partially Matched Crossover (UPMX),
Heuristic Sequencing Crossover (HeurX), and window-limited variations of common permutation mutation operators.
