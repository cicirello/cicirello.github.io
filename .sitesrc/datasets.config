<h2>Datasets</h2>
<p>This page contains datasets from my research, which spans a variety of applications of artificial intelligence, 
machine learning, evolutionary computation, and swarm intelligence.  You can also explore my datasets archived 
in the <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/vacicirello">Harvard Dataverse</a>.  
I will be adding more datasets here in the future:</p>

content="1"><strong>Weighted Tardiness Scheduling with Sequence-Dependent Setups</strong>: A 
benchmark set of instances for <a itemprop="url mainEntityOfPage" href="/datasets/wtsds/">Weighted 
Tardiness Scheduling with Sequence-Dependent Setups</a>, which is an NP-Hard single machine scheduling problem. The 
problem instances in this benchmark set have varying levels of duedate tightness, duedate range, and setup time severity.</p>

content="2"><strong>Mirror of various scheduling benchmarks</strong>: I have used a variety of scheduling
problems in my research over the years. I have collected some of 
the <a itemprop="url mainEntityOfPage" href="https://github.com/cicirello/scheduling-benchmarks">scheduling 
benchmark problem sets</a> in a GitHub repository as a mirror of the originals.</p>
