<h3><a href="/research/landscape/">Search Landscape Analysis</a></h3>
<p>Recently, I have been exploring the fitness landscapes of permutation optimization problems, problems where one must find an optimal ordering of
some discrete set (e.g., scheduling problems).  Such permutation problems fall into one of three broad categories, depending upon the structural characteristics
of greatest influence on solution fitness (absolute positioning of elements, relative positioning of elements, or element precedences), although some problems 
may span more than one of these categories.  Among other things, my research on permutation fitness landscapes has introduced a theoretical framework
enabling exploring the effects of these structural properties on search performance.  This includes the &quot;Permutation in a Haystack&quot; problem
which enables specifying permutation fitness landscapes; as well as the &quot;Calculus of Search Landscapes&quot;,
a new tool for search landscape analysis that focuses on rates of change of fitness landscape topology, complementing other search landscape analysis tools
such as fitness-distance correlation.  <a href="/research/landscape/">More info, including selected relevant publications....</a></p>

<h3><a href="/research/adaptive/">Self-Adaptive / Self-Tuning Metaheuristics</a></h3>
<p>Genetic algorithms, and more generally, evolutionary computation, along with other metaheuristics such as simulated annealing, ant colony optimization, etc,
often involve a large number of so-called control parameters (e.g., mutation and crossover rates in genetic algorithms, parameters to control the cooling schedule
in simulated annealing, and so forth).  Getting these control parameters &quot;right&quot; is often critical to search performance.  My research in this area
includes both automated parameter tuning, as well as self-adaptive metahueristics or automated parameter control.
My research in this area also includes multi-heuristic search.
Some forms of search require the guidance of a heuristic, and the &quot;best&quot; heuristic for a problem may vary widely from that of another problem, 
or may even vary across instances of a problem.  Some of my research has applied machine learning to enabling metaheuristics to adapt their choice of
heuristic.  <a href="/research/adaptive/">More info, including selected relevant publications....</a></p>

<h3><a href="/research/gaoperators/">Genetic Operators for Permutation Representation</a></h3>
<p>The permutation representation for genetic algorithms requires specialized operators. A wide variety of crossover and mutation
operators for permutations exist in the research literature. In my research on evolutionary computation for optimizing permutation structures,
I have developed several crossover and mutation operators, including Non-Wrapping Order Crossover (NWOX), Uniform Partially Matched Crossover (UPMX),
Heuristic Sequencing Crossover (HeurX), and window-limited variations of common permutation mutation operators.

<h3><a href="/research/metaheuristics/">Metaheuristic Development</a></h3>
<p>My research has lead to the development of new metaheuristics, including Value-Biased 
Stochastic Sampling (VBSS), and Wasp Behavior Inspired Stochastic Sampling (WHISTLING). Both VBSS 
and WHISTLING are stochastic sampling algorithms, which iteratively generate randomized solutions 
to an instance of an optimization problem while utilizing a heuristic for guidance.

<h3><a href="/research/swarms/">Swarm Intelligence</a></h3>
<p>Swarm intelligence refers to multiagent systems whose behavior is motivated 
by models of naturally occurring swarming systems, such as social insect swarms
(e.g., ants, wasps, etc). My past research in this area includes applications of 
models of wasp task allocation and wasp social hierarchy formation to industrial 
scheduling and coordination problems, as well as multirobot coordination in space 
exploration. I have also explored applications of swarming agents to data management 
and network monitoring on mobile ad hoc networks.  <a href="/research/swarms/">More info,

<h3><a href="/research/multiagent/">Multi-Agent Systems / Multi-Robot Systems</a></h3>
<p>Much of my research on multiagent / multirobot systems is specifically related to swarm intelligence. However,
I have additionally conducted research related to other aspects of these systems, including market-based 
coordination, security engineering of multiagent systems, issues related to mobile agents 
on ad hoc wireless networks, power aware agents, and multiagent collaboration tools.

<h3><a href="/research/aicae/">Applications of AI to Computer-Aided Engineering</a></h3>
<p>My research includes applications of artificial intelligence to problems within the broad 
domain of Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE). These problems mostly relate to data management 
in large engineering digital libraries, such as automated engineering format classification,
and search and retrieval of engineering artifacts, such as Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models 
based upon structural similarity. <a href="/research/aicae/">More info, including selected relevant publications....</a></p>
