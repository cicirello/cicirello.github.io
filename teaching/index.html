<h3>Courses Recently Taught</h3>
<p id="csci4600"><strong>CSCI 4600: Senior Seminar</strong>
(Last taught: Spring 2021, <a href="/teaching/syllabi/CSCI4600.pdf">Syllabus</a>):
In this seminar, computer science majors learn to evaluate the impact of current
computing practice and trends; and gain an understanding of professional, ethical,
and legal responsibilities. Students read and report on articles from the computing
literature, and also develop a professional resume.  <em>Fulfills university's Values/Ethics
(V) requirement.</em></p>
<p id="csci4463"><strong>CSCI 4463: Artificial Intelligence</strong>
(Last taught: Spring 2021, <a href="/teaching/syllabi/CSCI4463.pdf">Syllabus</a>):
A study of tools, techniques, and applications associated with intelligent computer systems.
The course will include topics from classical symbolic AI as well as topics from computational intelligence. Topics will
include intelligent problem-solving methods, knowledge representation, heuristics, genetic algorithms, and selected topics from machine learning.
<em>Counts as an elective for the Minor in Behavioral Neuroscience.</em></p>
<p id="csci4104"><strong>CSCI 4104: Data Structures and Algorithms II</strong>
(Last taught: Spring 2021, <a href="/teaching/syllabi/CSCI4104.pdf">Syllabus</a>):
In this course, students deepen their knowledge of the design and analysis of computer algorithms.
Advanced topics in algorithms and algorithm analysis covered in the course include graphs and graph algorithms, string matching,
multi-threaded algorithms, and NP-completeness. <em>Taught using Python.</em></p>
<p id="gnm2248"><strong>GNM 2248: Artificial Intelligence in Society</strong>
(Last taught: Fall 2020, <a href="/teaching/syllabi/GNM2248.pdf">Syllabus</a>):
This course will provide a broad overview and introduction to the field of artificial intelligence
(AI) focusing on the impacts it has made on society during the past 50 years. The intended audience for this course is that
of the general student. No mathematical background is required. The course will begin by providing a broad overview of what AI is,
and what it is not, including a discussion of the notions of Strong and Weak AI. Strong AI hypothesizes that the human mind is
nothing more than a computational device and thus that computers can in principle be programmed with the capability of thought
(i.e., to truly reason and solve problems). Contrast this with Weak AI which does not focus on whether machines can be made to
actually think, but rather whether machines can be made to act intelligently. We will read and discuss articles by the pioneering
scientists and philosophers that explore these notions. Next, the course will focus on introducing the student to applications
of AI that have been making their ways into our everyday lives. Attention will be placed on the ethical issues and the impacts
AI technology will continue to make on society. The course will include a combination of lectures, class discussion of films (both
fiction and non-fiction) and assigned readings (both non-fiction and fiction), as well as current day news articles.
<em>Counts as an elective for the Minor in Behavioral Neuroscience.</em> <em>Fulfills university's Historically Conscious (H) requirement, and offered as a Writing Across the Curriculum (W2) course.</em></p>

<p id="csci4510a"><strong>CSCI 4510: Topics in Computer Science: Human Performance Modeling</strong>
(Last taught: Spring 2010): In this course, students synthesize their computer science coursework experience to explore real world
problems of interest to local governmental agencies and industry. Working as a small group,
in close collaboration with the instructor, students explore research questions related to human
performance in aviation-related tasks (e.g., air traffic control). The course includes a study of
topics related to statistical data mining with an application to human performance modeling.</p>
<p id="csci4510b"><strong>CSCI 4510: Topics in Computer Science: Real World Applications of Intelligent Systems</strong>
(Last taught: Fall 2009): In this course, students synthesize their computer science coursework experience to explore real world
problems of interest to local governmental agencies and industry. Working as a small group,
in close collaboration with the instructor, students undertake research on air traffic management.</p>
<p id="csci4485"><strong>CSCI 4485: Software Engineering</strong>
(Last taught: Fall 2017, <a href="/teaching/syllabi/CSIS4485.pdf">Syllabus</a>):
This course covers software engineering fundamentals, including software
life cycle, process models, requirements engineering, software design,
coding, testing, team software development, and application of
engineering tools. Central to the course, student teams develop
projects to practice engineering knowledge and skills in a
realistic development setting.</p>
<p id="csci4481"><strong>CSCI 4481: Cryptography and Data Security</strong>
(Last taught: Fall 2018, <a href="/teaching/syllabi/CSIS4481.pdf">Syllabus</a>):
Cryptography has become an essential tool for data security. It is used to provide data
confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It
supports the authentication of data and protection of privacy.
However, cryptography is only one component of a
security system. There are hardware, software engineering,
social and political issues that also must be considered.
This course provides a broad view of security with practical
applications of cryptography to data security. Specific
topics include classical and modern encryption techniques,
steganography, and human factors.</p>
<p id="csis4466"><strong>CSIS 4466: Computer Graphics</strong>
(Last taught: Fall 2015, <a href="/teaching/syllabi/CSIS4466.pdf">Syllabus</a>):
This course provides an introduction to 2D and 3D computer graphics including the study of
hardware, software, algorithms, modeling, rendering, and applications. Topics will be introduced using the Java 2D and 3D APIs.</p>
<p id="csci3103"><strong>CSCI 3103: Data Structures and Algorithms I</strong>
(Last taught: Spring 2017, <a href="/teaching/syllabi/CSIS3103.pdf">Syllabus</a>):
Advanced topics in the specification, implementation, and use of important
data structures and associated algorithms. Data structures to be studied
include stacks, queues, lists, trees, heaps, priority queues, sets/maps,
and hash tables. Algorithm analysis is also studied, with emphasis on searching
and sorting. Programming projects provide experience using the concepts covered in the course.
