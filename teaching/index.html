<h3>Courses Recently Taught</h3>
<p id="csis4485"><strong>CSIS 4485: Software and Security Engineering</strong>
(Last taught: Fall 2016):  An introduction to software engineering and security engineering in software systems.
The course addresses universal software engineering techniques as well as techniques for development of critical
software systems where the cost of system failure is potentially high. Software engineering topics covered will
include software process models, agile software development methods, requirements engineering, system modeling,
architectural design, implementation, software testing, and evolution. Topics related to software dependability
and security engineering are also covered.</p>
<p id="csis4481"><strong>CSIS 4481: Cryptography and Data Security</strong>
(Last taught: Fall 2016): Cryptography has become an essential tool for data security. It is used to provide data
confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It supports the authentication of data and protection of privacy.
However, cryptography is only one component of a security system. There are hardware, software engineering,
social and political issues that also must be considered. This course provides a broad view of security with practical
applications of cryptography to data security. Specific topics include classical and modern encryption techniques,
steganography, and human factors.</p>
<p id="csis4466"><strong>CSIS 4466: Computer Graphics</strong>
(Last taught: Fall 2015): This course provides an introduction to 2D and 3D computer graphics including the study of
hardware, software, algorithms, modeling, rendering, and applications. Topics will be introduced using the Java 2D and 3D APIs.</p>
<p id="csis4463"><strong>CSIS 4463: Artificial Intelligence</strong>
(Last taught: Spring 2016): A study of tools, techniques, and applications associated with intelligent computer systems.
The course will include topics from classical symbolic AI as well as topics from computational intelligence. Topics will
include intelligent problem-solving methods, knowledge representation, heuristics, genetic algorithms, and selected topics from machine learning.
<em>Counts as an elective for the Minor in Behavioral Neuroscience.</em></p>
<p id="gnm2248"><strong>GNM 2248: Artificial Intelligence in Society</strong>
(Last taught: Spring 2016): This course will provide a broad overview and introduction to the field of artificial intelligence
(AI) focusing on the impacts it has made on society during the past 50 years. The intended audience for this course is that
of the general student. No mathematical background is required. The course will begin by providing a broad overview of what AI is,
and what it is not, including a discussion of the notions of Strong and Weak AI. Strong AI hypothesizes that the human mind is
nothing more than a computational device and thus that computers can in principle be programmed with the capability of thought
(i.e., to truly reason and solve problems). Contrast this with Weak AI which does not focus on whether machines can be made to
actually think, but rather whether machines can be made to act intelligently. We will read and discuss articles by the pioneering
scientists and philosophers that explore these notions. Next, the course will focus on introducing the student to applications
of AI that have been making their ways into our everyday lives. Attention will be placed on the ethical issues and the impacts
AI technology will continue to make on society. The course will include a combination of lectures, class discussion of films (both
fiction and non-fiction) and assigned readings (both non-fiction and fiction), as well as current day news articles.
<em>Counts as an elective for the Minor in Behavioral Neuroscience.</em> <em>Fulfills university's Historically Conscious (H) requirement, and offered as a Writing Across the Curriculum (W2) course.</em></p>
<p id="csis2226"><strong>CSIS 2226: Foundations of Computer Science (&quot;Discrete Math 2&quot;)</strong>
(Last taught: Spring 2014): This course will review and build upon the major concepts introduced in MATH 2225 and examine additional
mathematical topics needed for the study of computer and information science. A principal goal is the development of the ability
to think mathematically about computer science problems and their solutions. Computer-based exercises using the Python language
will provide students with additional experience with logic, induction and other methods of mathematical proof, and algorithms.
Students will also learn to formulate conjectures and investigate possible answers through computational experiments in Python.
Applications studied may include the verification of algorithms, the formal specification of software systems, semantics of
programming languages, automata, circuit design, and parallel computing.</p>

<h3>Other Courses Taught</h3>
<p>Courses in this section are those that I haven't taught for a while.</p>
<p id="csis4510a"><strong>CSIS 4510: Topics in Computer Science: Human Performance Modeling</strong>
(Last taught: Spring 2010): In this course, students synthesize their computer science coursework experience to explore real world
problems of interest to local governmental agencies and industry. Working as a small group,
in close collaboration with the instructor, students explore research questions related to human
performance in aviation-related tasks (e.g., air traffic control). The course includes a study of
topics related to statistical data mining with an application to human performance modeling.</p>
<p id="csis4510b"><strong>CSIS 4510: Topics in Computer Science: Real World Applications of Intelligent Systems</strong>
(Last taught: Fall 2009): In this course, students synthesize their computer science coursework experience to explore real world
problems of interest to local governmental agencies and industry. Working as a small group,
in close collaboration with the instructor, students undertake research on air traffic management.</p>
<p id="csis3103"><strong>CSIS 3103: Data Structures</strong>
(Last taught: Fall 2011): This course builds on the skills learned in the Programming and Problem Solving sequence. The
primary focus of the course is on the definition, specification, implementation, and use of the classic data structures and
supporting algorithms that are commonly used in modern software systems. Data structures to be studied include lists,
stacks, queues, trees, graphs and hash tables. Algorithm analysis will also be studied, with a focus on the efficiency of
searching and sorting methods. Programming projects will provide experience in applying the concepts covered in the
course. <em>Taught using Java.</em></p>
<p id="gnm2358"><strong>GNM 2358: Introduction to Game Theory</strong>
(Last taught: Fall 2007): This course will introduce the student to topics in Game Theory. Game Theory is a high level
mathematical field that governs conflict resolution and decision making skills. This course is an interesting blend of deep
mathematical theory and real-world practicality. Due to the rich applications associated with this field, this is a perfect course
for Math, Science, Business, Economic, and Psychology majors. The students will be introduced to theoretical mathematical
tools including matrices, vectors, and graph theory. In addition, students will be taught applications associated with Biology,
Politics, and Computer Science. Topics for the course include Two-player Zero-Sum (as well as Non-Zero-Sum) games of
perfect information, Pure and Mixed Strategies, Dominance, and Rationality.</p>
<p id="csis2102"><strong>CSIS 2102: Programming and Problem Solving II</strong>

Emphasis is placed on data abstraction and implementation techniques such as recursion and dynamic data structures;
and more advanced object oriented design concepts such as inheritance, exception handling, and GUI. Assignments involve
writing programs using these techniques in an integrated development environment. <em>Taught using Java.</em></p>
<p id="csis2101"><strong>CSIS 2101: Programming and Problem Solving I</strong>
