<h3>Courses Recently Taught</h3>
<p id="csci4600"><strong>CSCI 4600: Senior Seminar</strong>
(Last taught: Spring 2025, <a href="/teaching/syllabi/CSCI4600.pdf">Syllabus</a>):
In this seminar, computer science majors learn to evaluate the impact of current
computing practice and trends; and gain an understanding of professional, ethical,
and legal responsibilities. Students read and report on articles from the computing
literature, and also develop a professional resume.  <em>Fulfills university's Values/Ethics
(V) requirement.</em></p>
<p id="csci4510c"><strong>CSCI 4510: Topics in Computer Science: Applied Evolutionary Computation</strong>
(Last taught: Fall 2025):
In this course, we'll work in teams to build solutions to real world optimization problems using
evolutionary computation, and related algorithms. Evolutionary computation is a subfield of A.I.
that is focused on solving problems using algorithms inspired by natural genetics and evolution.
We'll use existing evolutionary computation libraries and frameworks. A secondary focus of the course
will involve learning and applying various professional development tools, frameworks, and services,
such as Apache Maven, GitHub (including GitHub's dependabot and GitHub Actions), various static analysis
tools (e.g., SpotBugs, EndSecBugs, RefactorFirst), the Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH), etc.
Coursework and grading will be based on lab assignments using the various tools, participation/attendance,
and a group project.</p>
<p id="csci4463"><strong>CSCI 4463: Artificial Intelligence</strong>
(Last taught: Spring 2025, <a href="/teaching/syllabi/CSCI4463.pdf">Syllabus</a>):
A study of tools, techniques, and applications associated with intelligent computer systems.
The course will include topics from classical symbolic AI as well as topics from computational intelligence. Topics will
include intelligent problem-solving methods, knowledge representation, heuristics, genetic algorithms, and selected topics from machine learning.
<em>Counts as an elective for the Minor in Behavioral Neuroscience.</em></p>
<p id="csci4104"><strong>CSCI 4104: Data Structures and Algorithms II</strong>
(Last taught: Fall 2024, <a href="/teaching/syllabi/CSCI4104.pdf">Syllabus</a>):
In this course, students deepen their knowledge of the design and analysis of computer algorithms.
Advanced topics in algorithms and algorithm analysis covered in the course include graphs and graph algorithms, string matching,
multi-threaded algorithms, and NP-completeness. <em>Taught using Python.</em></p>
<p id="gnm2248"><strong>GNM 2248: Artificial Intelligence in Society</strong>
(Last taught: Summer 2025, <a href="/teaching/syllabi/GNM2248.pdf">Syllabus</a>):
This course will provide a broad overview and introduction to the field of artificial intelligence
(AI) focusing on the impacts it has made on society during the past 50 years. The intended audience for this course is that
of the general student. No mathematical background is required. The course will begin by providing a broad overview of what AI is,
and what it is not, including a discussion of the notions of Strong and Weak AI. Strong AI hypothesizes that the human mind is
nothing more than a computational device and thus that computers can in principle be programmed with the capability of thought
(i.e., to truly reason and solve problems). Contrast this with Weak AI which does not focus on whether machines can be made to
actually think, but rather whether machines can be made to act intelligently. We will read and discuss articles by the pioneering
scientists and philosophers that explore these notions. Next, the course will focus on introducing the student to applications
of AI that have been making their ways into our everyday lives. Attention will be placed on the ethical issues and the impacts
AI technology will continue to make on society. The course will include a combination of lectures, class discussion of films (both
fiction and non-fiction) and assigned readings (both non-fiction and fiction), as well as current day news articles.
<em>Serves as an elective for the Minor in Behavioral Neuroscience.</em> <em>Fulfills university's Historically Conscious (H) requirement.</em></p>

Cryptography has become an essential tool for data security. It is used to provide data
confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It
supports the authentication of data and protection of privacy.
However, cryptography is only one component of a
security system. There are hardware, software engineering,
social and political issues that also must be considered.
This course provides a broad view of security with practical
