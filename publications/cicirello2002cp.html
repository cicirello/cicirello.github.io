<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Randomization as a means for improving search performance in combinatorial
domains has received increasing interest in recent years. In optimization
contexts, it can provide a means for overcoming the deficiencies of available
search heuristics and broadening search in productive directions. In this
paper, we consider the issue of amplifying the performance of a search
heuristic through randomization. We introduce a general framework for embedding
a base heuristic within an iterative sampling process and searching a
stochastic neighborhood of the heuristic&#8217;s prescribed trajectory. In
contrast to previous approaches, which have used rank-ordering as a basis for
randomization, our approach instead relies on assigned heuristic value. Use of
heuristic value is important because it makes it possible to vary the level of
stochasticity in relation to the discriminatory power of the heuristic in
different decision contexts, and hence concentrate search around those
decisions where the heuristic is least informative. To evaluate the efficacy of
the approach, we apply it to a complex, weighted-tardiness scheduling problem.
Taking a state-of-the-art heuristic for this scheduling problem as a starting
point, we demonstrate an ability to consistently and significantly improve on
the deterministic heuristic solution across a broad range of problem instances.
Our approach is also shown to consistently outperform a previously developed,
rank-ordering based approach to randomizing the same heuristic in terms of
percentage of improvement obtained.</p>
