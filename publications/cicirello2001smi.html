<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Solid models are the critical data elements in modern computer-aided design
(CAD) environments, describing the shape and form of manufactured artifacts.
Their growing ubiquity has created new problems in how to effectively manage
the many models that are now stored in the digital libraries of large design
and manufacturing enterprises. Existing techniques from the engineering
literature and from industrial practice, such as group technology, rely on
human-supervised encoding and classification, while techniques from the
multimedia database and computer graphics/vision communities often ignore the
manufacturing attributes most significant in the classification of models.</p>
<p>This paper presents our approach to the manufacturing similarly assessment
of solid models of mechanical parts based on machining features. Our technical
approach is three-fold: (1) perform machining feature extraction to map the
solid model to a set of STEP AP 224 machining features; (2) construct a model
dependency graph from the set of machining features; and (3) find the nearest
neighbors to the query graph using an iterative improvement search across a
database of other models. We also present empirical experiments to validate our
approach using our testbed, the National Design Repository.</p> <p>The
contribution of this research is the first fully automated technique for
machining feature-based comparisons of mechanical artifacts. We believe that
this work can lead to radical changes in the way in which design data is
managed in modern engineering enterprises.</p>
