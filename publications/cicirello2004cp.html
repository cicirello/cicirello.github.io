<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The success of stochastic algorithms is often due to their ability to
effectively amplify the performance of search heuristics. This is certainly the
case with stochastic sampling algorithms such as heuristic-biased stochastic
sampling (HBSS) and value-biased stochastic sampling (VBSS), wherein a
heuristic is used to bias a stochastic policy for choosing among alternative
branches in the search tree. One complication in getting the most out of
algorithms like HBSS and VBSS in a given problem domain is the need to identify
the most effective search heuristic. In many domains, the relative performance
of various heuristics tends to vary across different problem instances and no
single heuristic dominates. In such cases, the choice of any given heuristic
will be limiting and it would be advantageous to gain the collective power of
several heuristics. Toward this goal, this paper describes a framework for
integrating multiple heuristics within a stochastic sampling search algorithm.
In its essence, the framework uses online-generated statistical models of the
search performance of different base heuristics to select which to employ on
each subsequent iteration of the search. To estimate the solution quality
distribution resulting from repeated application of a strong heuristic within a
stochastic search, we propose the use of models from extreme value theory
(EVT). Our EVT-motivated approach is validated on the NP-Hard problem of
resource-constrained project scheduling with time windows (RCPSP/max). Using
VBSS as a base stochastic sampling algorithm, the integrated use of a set of
project scheduling heuristics is shown to be competitive with the current best
known heuristic algorithm for RCPSP/max and in some cases even improves upon
best known solutions to difficult benchmark instances.</p>
