<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Agent-based approaches to manufacturing scheduling and control have gained
increasing attention in recent years. Such approaches are attractive because
they offer increased robustness against the unpredictability of factory
operations. But the specification of local coordination policies that give rise
to efficient global performance and effectively adapt to changing circumstances
remains an interesting challenge. In this paper, we present a new approach to
this coordination problem, drawing on various aspects of a computational model
of how wasp colonies coordinate individual activities and allocate tasks to
meet the collective needs of the nest.</p> <p>We focus specifically on the
problem of configuring parallel multi-purpose machines in a factory to best
satisfy product demands over time. Wasp-like computational agents that we call
routing wasps act as overall machine proxies. These agents use a model of wasp
task allocation behavior, coupled with a model of wasp dominance hierarchy
formation, to determine which new jobs should be accepted into the
machine&#8217;s queue. If you view our system from a market-oriented
perspective, the policies that the routing wasps independently adapt for their
respective machines can be likened to policies for deciding when to bid and
when not to bid for arriving jobs.</p> <p>We benchmark the performance of our
system on the real-world problem of assigning trucks to paint booths in a
simulated vehicle paintshop. The objective of this problem is to minimize the
number of paint color changes accrued by the system, assuming no a priori
knowledge of the color sequence or color distribution of trucks arriving in the
system. We demonstrate that our system outperforms the bidding mechanism
originally implemented for the problem as well as another related adaptive
bidding mechanism.</p>
