<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Agent-based approaches to manufacturing scheduling and control have gained
increasing attention in recent years. Such approaches are attractive because
they offer increased robustness against the unpredictability of factory
operations. But the specification of local coordination policies that give rise
to efficient global performance and effectively adapt to changing circumstances
remains an interesting challenge. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to
this coordination problem, drawing on various aspects of a computational model
of how wasp colonies coordinate individual activities and allocate tasks to
meet the collective needs of the nest. We focus specifically on the problem of
configuring machines in a factory to best satisfy (potentially changing)
product demands over time. Our system models the set of jobs queued in front of
any given machine as a wasp nest, wherein wasp-like agents interact to form a
social hierarchy and prioritize the jobs that they represent. Other wasp-like
agents external to the nest act as overall machine proxies, and use a model of
wasp task allocation behavior to determine which new jobs should be accepted
into the machine&#8217;s queue. We show for simple factories that our
multi-agent system achieves the desired effect. For a given job mix, the system
converges to a factory configuration that maximizes overall performance, and as
the job mix changes, the system quickly adapts to a new, more appropriate
configuration.</p>
