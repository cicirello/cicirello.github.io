<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In recent years, the desire for a more robust basis for coordination in
manufacturing environments has motivated research into agent-based approaches
to manufacturing scheduling and control. We have been developing a series of
such multi-agent systems inspired by models of social insect behavior for the
problem of dynamic shop floor routing. To date, all of our results have been
empirical in terms of global system performance and we have been without any
satisfying explanation for the behavior of the interacting agents of these
systems. This paper is an attempt to model these interactions in game-theoretic
terms as normal form games. In the analysis, we show that the behavior of the
agents in a repeated game scenario appears to converge upon the repeated play
of Nash Equilibria (NE). This analysis consists of the examination of games
corresponding to specific problem instances. Some of the systems in this study
tend to converge upon deficient NE; while the others successfully coordinate
upon &quot;better&quot; equilibria on a consistent basis.</p>
