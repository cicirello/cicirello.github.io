<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Local search algorithms, such as simulated annealing, tabu search, and local
hill climbers attempt to optimize a solution to a problem by making locally
improving modifications to a candidate solution. They rely on a neighborhood
operator to restrict the search to a typically small set of possible successor
states. The genetic algorithm mutation operator, likewise, enables the
exploration of the local neighborhood of candidate solutions within the genetic
algorithm&#8217;s population. In this paper, we profile window-limited
variations of several commonly employed neighborhood operators for problems in
which candidate solutions are represented as permutations. Window-limited
neighborhood operators enable tuning the size of the local neighborhood-e.g.,
to balance cost of search step against likelihood of getting stuck in a local
optima. Window limits potentially can even be adjusted dynamically during
search-e.g., to give a stagnated search a &quot;kick.&quot; We provide profiles
of the distance characteristics of window-limited variations of several of the
more common permutation neighborhood operators.</p>
