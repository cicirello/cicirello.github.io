the effectiveness of VBSS is the choice of the heuristic function. The job of
the heuristic function is to provide problem dependent evaluation of the

during the problem solving process. At the time of the design of such an
algorithm, it may not be obvious which of several heuristics are best. During
the past few years, we have been developing techniques for allowing VBSS to
self-select which heuristic to use. Our approach relies on modeling the
distribution of the quality of solutions obtained by VBSS over its allocated
set of restarts. This paper presents some of our analysis of potential models,
including goodness of fit tests for several possible assumptions we can make
about the distribution of the quality of solutions. Our analysis leads us to
the selection of the Generalized Extreme Value Distribution for our models of
randomized heuristic performance.">

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<div itemprop="description"><p>The complexity of many combinatorial optimization problems often preclude the
application of exact problem solving techniques as the problem is scaled to
real-world size. For example, for a problem that is NP-Hard in the strong
sense, any algorithm that guarantees that its solutions are optimal is going to
be limited in the size of the instance that it can solve given computational
limitations. Rather than requiring &quot;optimal&quot; solutions, an
alternative is to favor sufficiently good solutions that can be found
efficiently. One approach to this uses a randomized heuristic algorithm. This
paper specifically considers an algorithm known as Value Biased Stochastic
Sampling (VBSS). VBSS uses a heuristic function to bias the random generation
of a proposed solution to the problem. This process is repeated some number of
times and retains only the best solution found over several trials. The key to
the effectiveness of VBSS is the choice of the heuristic function. The job of
the heuristic function is to provide problem dependent evaluation of the
choices that can be made. This evaluation is used to bias the random decisions
during the problem solving process. At the time of the design of such an
algorithm, it may not be obvious which of several heuristics are best. During
the past few years, we have been developing techniques for allowing VBSS to
self-select which heuristic to use. Our approach relies on modeling the
distribution of the quality of solutions obtained by VBSS over its allocated
set of restarts. This paper presents some of our analysis of potential models,
including goodness of fit tests for several possible assumptions we can make
about the distribution of the quality of solutions. Our analysis leads us to
the selection of the Generalized Extreme Value Distribution for our models of
randomized heuristic performance.</p></div>
