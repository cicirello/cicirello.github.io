<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The Secure Wireless Agent Testbed (SWAT) is a unique facility developed at
Drexel University in collaboration with Sarnoff Corporation to study
integration, networking and information assurance for next-generation wireless
mobile agent systems. It is the only known implemented system fully
integrating: mobile agents, MANETs, and security. The authors believe that SWAT
is the largest known multi-agent system living on a MANET (802.11b wireless
network with ad hoc routing), consisting of dozens of mobile hosts (PDAs,
laptops) and thousands of static and mobile software agents. Novel mechanisms
have been developed for SWAT integrating autonomous agent technologies with
public-key and symmetric key encryption to support secure communication, at
multiple OSI layers, among groups of hosts and agents.</p> <p>SWAT Security is
monitored by agents that manage keys, assess network traffic patterns and
analyze host behaviors. Agents can use machine learning to develop profiles for
nominal agent, hardware platform and network states. Given learned profiles,
detection agents identify specific problems in SWAT, including
over-runs/capture, and malicious insiders. Other agents monitor the health of
the network and the devices in the network, looking for network attacks and
security breaches. Using this framework, agents can revoke access rights for
suspicious hosts or agents and adaptively re-route traffic at the network layer
to improve the information integrity of the overall system. Agents also provide
the implementation framework for decentralized user applications, including
those for authentication, collaboration, messaging, and remote sensor
