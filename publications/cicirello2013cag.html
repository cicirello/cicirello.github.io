<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>There are hundreds of distinct 3D, CAD and engineering file formats. As
engineering design and analysis has become increasingly digital, the
proliferation of file formats has created many problems for data preservation,
data exchange, and interoperability. In some situations, physical file objects
exist on legacy media and must be identified and interpreted for reuse. In
other cases, file objects may have varying representational expressiveness.</p>
<p>We introduce the problem of automated file recognition and classification in
emerging digital engineering environments, where all design, manufacturing and
production activities are &quot;born digital.&quot; The result is that massive
quantities and varieties of data objects are created during the product
lifecycle.</p> <p>This paper presents an approach to automated identification
of engineering file formats. This work operates independent of any modeling
tools and can identify families of related file objects as well as variations
in versions. This problem is challenging as it cannot assume any a priori
knowledge about the nature of the physical file object. Applications for these
methods include support for a number of emerging applications in areas such as
forensic analysis, data translation, as well as digital curation and long-term
data management.</p>
