<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Active learning has become an important part of effective computer science
pedagogy. Active learning helps to keep students engaged in the learning
process and is useful at all levels of computer science education from
introductory courses on programming through more advanced upper level topics
and graduate level coursework. In this paper, we present an active learning
exercise that we developed for use in courses on artificial intelligence for
demonstrating heuristic search concepts as well as concepts related to swarm
intelligence. We have also found the exercise useful in an interdisciplinary
course for non-majors to demonstrate some of the problem solving approaches of
computer science. It is also applicable to courses on discrete mathematics. The
exercise that we call Collective Bin Packing is an adaptation of the well-known
combinatorial optimization problem known as bin packing. During the exercise,
students take turns deciding upon individual problem solving steps. A follow-up
class discussion draws out the algorithmic elements of the students&#8217;
collective reasoning process. An interactive Java application is used to
facilitate the group problem solving exercise.</p>
