<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This article introduces a course the author recently designed; and which was
first taught in Fall 2006. The course provides an introduction to the field of
artificial intelligence (AI) focused at non-majors as part of a liberal arts
curriculum. The course provides an overview of the foundational science and
philosophy at the heart of AI from an interdisciplinary perspective. The course
largely focuses on the diverse applications to many fields of endeavor, and the
impact AI is beginning to have on areas of society as well as the potential
future impact. The course draws together topics from diverse fields including
computer science, philosophy, psychology, game theory, among others. One of the
goals of the course is to engage students from disciplines outside the
computing sciences, while drawing on the strengths of their individual
backgrounds. A secondary objective is to raise awareness among students outside
of the computing sciences that there is more to computer science than
programming and mathematics (e.g., that some CS topics are highly
interdisciplinary). A key teaching element of this course is that of utilizing
prior knowledge for discussion context.</p>
