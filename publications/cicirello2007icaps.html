<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Designing a scheduling competition to attract researchers from the several
fields interested in scheduling problems seems a challenging, and highly
worthwhile effort. In this paper, we propose a design for one possible track of
this proposed scheduling competition. Specifically, we propose a track aimed at
one machine sequencing problems. We argue that any such track must include
problems with sequence-dependent setups. Our proposed single machine sequencing
track would additionally include a spectrum of objective functions of
increasing optimization difficulty under sequence-dependent setups. We also
offer a problem instance generator along with a set of benchmark problem
instances for one potential competition problem—the weighted tardiness
scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setups.</p>
