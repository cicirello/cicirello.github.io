<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In this paper, we present a group, asynchronous problem solving exercise
designed to introduce non-computer science students to a variety of concepts
from artificial intelligence and operations research. The exercise is designed
to be a Computer Science (CS) Unplugged activity suitable for the online
classroom. CS Unplugged is a methodology for teaching CS concepts using
hands-on interactive activities without using a computer. CS Unplugged
activities are often used to introduce CS concepts to novices, such as
elementary, middle, or high school students; but can also be effective at
engaging the non-CS undergraduate student. By definition, CS Unplugged seems at
odds with online education, as the participants in the exercise are necessarily
using computers. We present an interactive activity motivated by CS Unplugged,
but implemented within an asynchronous threaded discussion board. The activity
is based on the well-known Bin Packing problem, and is specifically an
extension of an existing active learning exercise known as Collective Bin
Packing but adapted to the online classroom. The activity is designed for an
undergraduate interdisciplinary course as part of a liberal arts curriculum.</p>
