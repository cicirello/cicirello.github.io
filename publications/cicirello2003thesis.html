<h4>Abstract</h4>
<div itemprop="description"><p>In many combinatorial domains, simple stochastic algorithms often exhibit
superior performance when compared to highly customized approaches. Many of
these simple algorithms outperform more sophisticated approaches on difficult
benchmark problems; and often lead to better solutions as the algorithms are
taken out of the world of benchmarks and into the real-world. Simple stochastic
algorithms are often robust, scalable problem solvers.</p> <p>This thesis
explores methods for combining sets of heuristics within a single stochastic
search. The ability of stochastic search to amplify heuristics is often a key
factor in its success. Heuristics are not, however, infallible and in most
domains no single heuristic dominates. It is therefore desirable to gain the
collective power of a set of heuristics; and to design a search control
framework capable of producing a hybrid algorithm from component heuristics
with the ability to customize itself to a given problem instance. A primary
goal is to explore what can be learned from quality distributions of iterative
stochastic search in combinatorial optimization domains; and to exploit models
of quality distributions to enhance the performance of stochastic problem
solvers. We hypothesize that models of solution quality can lead to effective
search control mechanisms, providing a general framework for combining multiple
heuristics into an enhanced decision-making process. These goals lead to the
development of a search control framework, called QD-BEACON, that uses
online-generated statistical models of search performance to effectively
combine search heuristics. A prerequisite goal is to develop a suitable
stochastic sampling algorithm for combinatorial search problems. This goal
leads to the development of an algorithm called VBSS that makes better use, in
general, of the discriminatory power of a given search heuristic as compared to
existing sampling approaches.</p> <p>The search frameworks of this thesis are
evaluated on combinatorial optimization problems. Specifically, we show that:
1) VBSS is an effective method for amplifying heuristic performance for the
weighted tardiness sequencing problem with sequence-dependent setups; 2)
QD-BEACON can enhance the current best known algorithm for weighted tardiness
sequencing; and 3) QD-BEACON and VBSS together provide the new best heuristic
algorithm for the constrained optimization problem known as RCPSP/max.</p></div>
