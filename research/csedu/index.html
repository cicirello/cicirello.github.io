<h3>Educational Software</h3>
<p><strong>Interactive Bin Packing:</strong> The Interactive Bin Packing application
provides a self-guided tutorial on combinatorial optimization, the bin packing problem,
and constructive heuristics for bin packing. It also enables the user to interact with bin
packing instances to explore their own problem-solving strategies, or to test their
knowledge of the various constructive heuristics covered by the tutorial. It is detailed
in an article in the Journal of Open Source Education titled
<a href="/publications/cicirello2022jose.html">Interactive Bin Packing: A Java Application for
Learning Constructive Heuristics for Combinatorial Optimization</a>. The application
is not a solver for bin packing. Interactive Bin Packing is a tool for learning about the bin
packing problem, as well as learning about heuristic techniques for solving instances of the
problem. You can find out more about the application, such as download instructions, the source
repository, etc on the page about my <a href="/software/csedu/">open source computer science education
software</a>.</p>

<h3>Software Engineering</h3>
<p><strong>Student Developed Educational Tools:</strong> In computer science courses on software
engineering, it is common practice for students to work in teams to develop a project. Such courses
typically cover the fundamental software processes spanning the software development lifecycle, from
requirements specification through architectural design, implementation, testing, and evolution, along
with the software tools that support the development activities. The project component of such courses
enable students to develop both their technical skills as well as their ability to work effectively
in teams and to communicate well with others. There are many approaches that instructors of such courses
take for the structure of projects. In the paper, <a href="/publications/cicirello2017ccsce.html">Student
Developed Computer Science Educational Tools as Software Engineering Course Projects</a>, I discuss my
approach that involves student teams developing an educational tool (e.g., a tutorial application,
educational game, etc) for learning about a computer science topic. The student teams choose the target
CS topic for their project. In addition to learning and experiencing software engineering processes and
tools, they also reinforce their earlier foundational knowledge as they develop a tool to assist
others in learning those foundational CS concepts. We found that students who developed CS learning
tools in this course perceived a greater increase in learning progress on fundamental principles,
theories, and factual knowledge, as compared to their peers in course sections that utilized Real
Projects for Real Clients, with an equivalent effect on teamwork and collaboration skills. Surprisingly,
the students who develop CS learning tools also report a significantly higher level of progress on
industrial relevant skill development as compared to the students who developed so called Real projects
for Real Clients.</p>
<div class="container-for-ad"><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6813707428591829" data-ad-slot="7210939788" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong>Real Projects for Real Clients Courses:</strong> In the paper
<a href="/publications/cicirello2013ccscne1.html">Experiences with a Real Projects for Real Clients Course on
Software Engineering at a Liberal Arts Institution</a>, I present my experience and observations on the
use of the Real Projects for Real Clients Course (RPRCC) methodology in a senior-level course on Software
Engineering. In an RPRCC, students work on a project (usually as a team) whose deliverables serve the needs
of a real client. RPRCCs are examples of service learning. In our experience, recruiting potential real clients
is very easy within a university environment (e.g., a simple email to faculty and staff, explaining the concept,
and more than enough project ideas will emerge). Within a Software Engineering course, students gain valuable
experience in both technical topics (software architecture, design patterns, etc) as well as soft skills
(teamwork, communications, etc). The paper provides details on the course content and structure, the process and
results of recruiting real clients, how teamwork and individual contributions to projects was assessed, and effects
on student outcomes.</p>

<h3>CS Unplugged</h3>
<p><strong>Collective Bin Packing:</strong> CS Unplugged is a methodology where computer science
concepts are taught using active learning activities, often as a group, without the use of a
computer. In such activities, the students often become the processing components. One such
CS Unplugged activity is one that I call Collective Bin Packing, and which I proposed in the
paper <a href="/publications/cicirello2009ccscne2.html">Collective Bin Packing: An Active Learning
Exercise</a>. It involves the NP-Complete problem known as bin packing. In the bin packing problem,
one has a set of objects they need to fit into bins. In the NP-Complete version of the problem, one
must determine whether the set of objects can be placed into a specified number of bins.
And in the NP-Hard optimization variant of the problem, one must find the assignment of objects
to bins that minimizes the number of bins used. Bin packing offers a puzzle-like experience
for the learner.</p>
<p>In the Collective Bin Packing activity, the class as a group works through
an instance of the bin packing problem. One of the original objectives of the activity
was to teach the concept of collective intelligence, often encountered in swarms, where
individual members of the swarm have limited intelligence, while the emergent behavior of
the swarm can sometimes appear to be quite advanced exhibiting an intelligence that is
greater than its constituent components. During the activity, students take turns taking one
action, such as putting an object into a bin with space, or removing an object from a bin.
In this version of the activity, students don't explain their chosen action, simply allowing
the solution to emerge from their collective actions. You can also use the activity to teach
about constructive heuristics, explaining a heuristic like first-fit or best-fit, and having
students take turns taking the appropriate action from a specific heuristic.</p>
<div class="container-for-ad"><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6813707428591829" data-ad-slot="7865545903" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong>CS Unplugged in an Online Asynchronous Course:</strong> I later adapted the Collective
Bin Packing activity to an activity for groups within discussion threads of an online
asynchronous course. The online course version of Collective Bin Packing is detailed in the paper
<a href="/publications/cicirello2013ccscne2.html">A CS Unplugged Activity for the Online Classroom</a>.
In that paper, I also present my experiences and observations in utilizing it within an online
classroom environment taught in an asynchronous modality.</p>
<p><strong>AI for Non-Majors Course:</strong> The CS Unplugged version of the Collective Bin
Packing activity was originally designed for use in an asynchronous online course on
artificial intelligence for non-majors at a liberal arts institution. That course,
Artificial Intelligence in Society, is discussed in the paper <a href="/publications/cicirello2008ccsce.html">An
Interdisciplinary Course on Artificial Intelligence Designed for a Liberal Arts Curriculum</a>.</p>

<h3>CS 1 / CS2 Courses</h3>
<p><strong>Pair Formation in Pair Programming:</strong> In the paper <a href="/publications/cicirello2009ccscne1.html">On
Self-Selected Pairing in CS1: Who Pairs with Whom?</a>, I explored the dynamics of pair formation in
a CS1 course. The study spanned three years. Pair programming has been shown to be beneficial at all
levels of programming skill. Pair programming originated as part of extreme programming, but was then
quickly adopted by educators within classroom contexts. In pair programming, two programmers work
together on code, often from a single workstation. While one writes code, the other offers guidance
and reviews code syntax and logic, and plans algorithmic strategies. The roles are reversed
periodically at regular intervals. In this study, the students had the option to either work
independently or to work as a pair for assignments. If they chose to work as a pair, they were
required to follow the pair programming protocol. Our aim was to learn about the students who
chose to pair program, how often they chose to pair program (e.g., they could choose to pair for
some assignments but not others), and who they chose to pair with (e.g., same majors, etc). The
detailed results are in the paper. A few of the findings include that math majors are more likely
to choose pair programming than either computer science or information systems majors, and math majors
more often choose to pair with other math majors. Additionally, when computer science and information
systems majors chose to pair, they more often paired with a non-major, possibly indicating a self-chosen
mentoring role.</p>
<div class="container-for-ad"><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6813707428591829" data-ad-slot="9105812677" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong>Effectiveness of Pop Quizzes:</strong> During a three-year period, I examined
the impact of pop quizzes in a CS-1 course. The detailed results of the study can be found in a
paper titled <a href="/publications/cicirello2009sigcse.html">On the Role and Effectiveness
of Pop Quizzes in CS1</a>, published in SIGCSE 2009. Performance on exams and programming
assignments were improved for the students in the course sections that experienced pop
quizzes, as compared to those in the course sections without pop quizzes. The benefit of
pop quizzes was greater for those majoring in either computer science or information systems
than it was for non-majors. Juniors and seniors also benefitted more from pop quizzes
than freshmen and sophomores. The quizzes themselves were low stakes, with 50% of the
grade on a quiz coming strictly by taking it. The surprise nature of the quizzes acts to
encourage students to continually review and prepare. Additionally, regular quizzes provide
continual feedback to students about their learning progress, while also informing the instructor
of topics that may need additional attention or review.</p>
